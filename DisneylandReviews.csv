1564,2016-1,"Ok, this one will be a short one. You want to visit Disneyland to dream with your kids, right ? Ok then Hong Kong Disney is nothing but the dream.... and why ? Well, the longest queues you will ever stand for, losing your time. Oh and then the dirt on the floor, I will not even go into details, because it is quite disgusting to be honest. The overpopulation in the park and the mass of people make the trip unbareable to be honest. The huge dissappointed and specially when you know Disney Paris, Florida or California... So one good advise. Do not settle for less. Go to the real Disney, dont settle for the mediocre one just because it is nearer......Dont do that to your kids. "
1565,2016-1,We loved visiting Disneyland! I went there with my partner and it was the first time for both of us to visit any Disneyland and we really enjoyed all the rides and seeing all the characters walking around. We stayed there all day and really enjoyed the firework show on the night! 
1566,2016-1,"We spent only a day at Disneyland, due to time constraints. But a day is definitely not enough to explore everything. From Adventure Land to Toy Story Land to the Magical Castle   you have to experience it all. Queues to get into rides were a bit long (as can be expected), but so worth it. Don't forget to get your photo taken with Mickey and Minnie and Woody! And keep some extra cash to pick up amazing souvenirs from the various shops. What an unforgettable experience!"
1567,2016-1,"Pricing of Hong Kong Disneyland from 16 December 2016 increased from original HK$539 to HK$589 adult; then chirdren's tickets increased from HK$385 to HK$419 whereas elderly ticket remains unchanged at HK$100. Personally not recommended, it costs already HK$1,597 if you are a family of 3 people. (2 adults and one child) plus. the food inside Disneyland is not cheap."
1568,2016-1,"Avoid rush, reach early and directly go to the best rides.   I would rate ToyStory ride (in tomorrowland) the best. There are some amazing roller coaster rides for the brave hearts too,"
1569,2016-1,I visited Hong Kong Disneyland on January 2016 with my daughter and sisters. This is my first time went to Disneyland and I love everything there. Well this is really a place  where adults can be child again..
1570,2016-1,The smallest Disneyland in the world.  Take the MTR Tung Chung Line is the most convenient way to the theme park.
1571,2016-1,"I came to on Disneyland holiday, it's lots of people...we use long time for queue. It makes me feel crowded. But it is worth it and a good chance to dating with family,friends,partners and couples.Disneyland is very good for taking photo and the shop is so great, we can buy many souvenir. They are cute and funny. I buy some souvenir even though they are very expensive. Haha!!!One of the most amazing magic in the Disney park is a  talking trash can  in the world of tomorrow. It is cute!!I felt very romantic at night, because it will have a firework display, many people will see it before they left. It is very beautiful.It is a good place suitable for every age! Especially for the children, the will feel happy after they saw many kind of cartoon character. They can take a picture with them and they will very enjoyable."
1572,2016-1,"It is accessible by MTR, bus, car from the city, and is located in a quiet spot away from the hustle and bustle of the city. It duplicates the buildings, decorations, garden and theme parks of the Disney World, but on a smaller scale. The attractions are good for tourists in Hong Kong and from mainland China. There is a Disney hotel close by and a very nice restaurant."
1573,2016-1,"castle, restos, rides, parks, parades and of course fireworks! feels like i am younger again, the characters are complete though the queues are beyond! we went there on weekend so we expected to get busy in the park. i would say our trip was great! mickey, pls be me!"
1574,2016-1,"when you're with friends whom you consider family, you know you're home. disneyland will make you feel exactly the same thing regardless who are with you because it has the complete ingredients to take away the sadness brewing inside, just like a family who'll always stick with you no matter what. i want to go back there again but with my son & husband next time."
1575,2016-1,A whole day of fun for the family. Probably need another day. Easy to get to. Just catch the main train & change to the Disney shuttle train. Even the shuttle has Disney theme.Went during sunny winter day   neither hot nor cold. Beat the Chinese New Year holiday crowd a few weeks ahead. Queue are shorter & less waiting around.
1576,2016-1,This place is very lively. The rides out here are good. Any one going here must wait till the end to watch the parade. It is too good.
1577,2016-1,Went here with my family and husband last January 2016. We get to ride everything we chose. There were no lines because I believe a rainy season in HK so theres no much tourists. Dont bother waiting in long line at the car rides unless you have kids lol!
1578,2016-1,This was the highlight of my trip so far! Nothing can ever beat the feeling of watching the fireworks during the night. I felt like I was a kid all over again and seeing all these beauty really made me happy. I'll really come back here again soon.
1579,2016-1,"I already expected less when I went there. It is smaller than Tokyo's and basically has the same rides. Even the street peddler actually sells similar food, like turkey leg. Maybe all disneyland across the world having same kind of food. Surprisingly it's not as crowded as Tokyo's, and I covered all the rides in one day.The toilet pretty much well maintained, a lady will watch for every toilet and clean the stall once someone finish. But you can't avoid ill mannered tourist who doesn't know how to flush properly (and the toilet lady angry in cantonese).The most amazing thing there, I lost my passport. I went back a day after and successfully retrieve it without not much hassle. Note that they didn't allow selfie stick (I don't know why). Security will warn if you still insist."
1580,2016-1,"It's okay, it's small, are the rides shorter cause they feel shorter ?  I wunder if Shanghai Disney is a better day out ."
1581,2016-1,"We allowed a full day for this, getting to the park nice and early. We needn't have rushed   it's so small it really doesn't take very long to get round the whole park. The up side is that means you can take things a bit slower knowing that you'll still get to see everything. "
1582,2016-1,"An entire day of magical fun for Disney lovers. 1) do not miss the light up at night and the fireworks at closing!2) the light parade (paint the night) was spectacular. If you get a chance, do go there!3) food was not good and very expensive. Be prepared to pay for it, or pack. This cost the review one star.4) not many fast passes, please plan your day carefully!5) make time for the shows, they are worth it. I went for festival of the lion king, it was great."
1583,2016-2,"As it was winter time in HK, it was perfect for visiting Disneyland.  There are so many rides to go on and many places to look at.  Great train ride around the park.  The end of day fireworks are spectacular and not to be missed!!"
1584,2016-2,"It's beautifull, it's green, it's well maintained, it's mostly well managed.There are various attractions and amazing shows.The food, services and facilities are excellent.Just avoid the crowd on Public holidays and Sundays or be prepare to queue for a long time at each spot.Nevertheless, I would not recommand this park for teenagers and adults (except with little ones) because they could get bored. It is very different from American or European DisneyParks and is clearly dedicated to the youngest ones here. Pricey too. "
1585,2016-2,"I've been to every Disney resort there is and this one is definitely the smallest and least visited but I have no idea why. Shanghai Disney has not opened yet and amusement parks are such huge attractions in Asia. It felt like Disneyland in Anaheim (my favorite Disney park) placed on an exotic island since behind Sleeping Beauty Castle there are mountains and the ocean is not far. Not as many rides as the other Disney parks and it is only one park, but nonetheless it is still a magical time. Lines are very short since attendance is not that high, the hotels are beautiful, and it gives you that Disney feel and you almost forget that you are in Hong Kong, for a second I thought I was in Anaheim. Almost always no wait for Space Mountain."
1586,2016-2,"I visited HK Disneyland with my family in January 2016. We visited here right after we visited Ocean Park in Hong Kong. We had not planned for the visit but we took a cab there from our hotel in Kowloon (the fare was approximately 200 HKD as I remember) and bought tickets there that morning. There is also an option to take the metro there but we did not use this facility. There was a little bit of rain and it was very overcast so we were apprehensive initially, but it didn't rain too much and we had a lot of fun! There wasn't too much of a crowd on the day (perhaps due to the weather), which made it all the more fun. In comparison with Ocean Park, Disneyland is much smaller and doesn't have as many 'grown up' or thrilling rides, but has its own special charm. The food here was great   we had the caramel popcorn and other snacks from the carts and for lunch we had the Indian meals at the Tahitian Terrace. The staff throughout the park are very friendly and extremely professional. My favorite rides were the Runaway Mine Cars in the Grizzly Gulch, the RC Racer and Space Mountain. There is currency exchange facility available at guest services by the entrance in case you need some cash as there are places where you may need to spend cash (eg. the food carts). You can take advantage of the Fastpass facility at certain rides in case of long queues.Overall we had a great day here!"
1587,2016-2,Place is designed superbly . Try to take maximum snaps . Rides are not that much for Teenagers. its mostly or the Children.
1588,2016-2,Bought the tickets via Klook. A bit cheaper than normal and you wouldn't have to queue. Just show the QR Code at the entrance and zoom your way in. Great for family and kids. Plenty of rides and shows for the entire family. Food throughout the entire park. For those thrill seekers expecting extreme rides would be disappointed as there are only 3 of them. I would range them mild. The highlight of the Park is the fireworks show towards the end. It is worth the wait.
1589,2016-2," Too bad the small world area is closed that time.  To maximize the entrance fee you paid, you should allot a whole day there because the cue will take most of your time No good restaurant and expensive as well!  Just roaming around makes me happy Make su"
1590,2016-2,"Disneyland is a lovely place for kids. The train to Disneyland is beautiful, pink in colour with Mickey's face as windows. Disneyland is also great, specially the evening parade. Couldn't find much to eat in vegetarian. Rides were good. Overall, it was a lovely place mainly for kids."
1591,2016-2,"Really enjoy the show & game here especially with kids below 9yrs. I'm not worry about the food because got 1 halal restaurant served halal meal (The Explores Club). Prayer room do have & located at City Hall. No need go very far away, H.Kong is the nearest to go Disneyland from Malaysia."
1592,2016-2,"So excited to be with our daughters family. When we stopped at train station there was the Disney train,wow amazing . Don,t want yo tell all don,t want spoil your trip. Your eye are wide open looking this way that way just awesome. If you are a pensioner ask, this was cheaper that kids. Just to sit and see the eye on the faces on the kids and big kids alike. A must trip"
1593,2016-2,Great place for kids to have fun with disney charecters.   should reach early to cover the whole place
1594,2016-2,"Its really beautiful fairy world, every one must visit this attraction. We bought tickets online from klook.com as it is more convenient and you do not have stand in long queues. Online tickets are available at discounted prices. You can also buy tickets from China Tourism counter at Hong Kong airport at discounted price."
1595,2016-2,"For full 1 day,it was like revisiting your childhood.To add icing on the cake,my kids were a part of this.Extremely nice place & a must do in your travel itinerary in case you are planning Hong Kong travel.Expect the unexpected here, rides,food,castles,characters.. You name it...it's right there.It's a place,you must try...not alone..kids make it even more memorable. Day end parade was out of this world..great place to carry memories forever"
1596,2016-2,HKDL is a fun theme park for everyone. If you love to see fireworks you can wait for them everyday and easy transportation to HK down town.
1597,2016-2,"It was my first time to go to Disney theme park. We stayed at Kingdom club in Disney hotel so had special entry gate to right end of gate options which made entry quick & easy. When we booked our Disney tickets we were unsure if we were wasting a day of our time in Hong Kong. But we had a fabulous day which was without a doubt our best Disney park experience. We initially though that normal theme park might queue for rides long time, cost, quality of food and overall experience. However, Hong Kong Disneyland is the opposite it wasn't too busy, granted it was a weekday and not peak season. There were no hour long lines for rides most were 5 15 mins so you can do all the rides in one day. It is a well structured park and it was nice to be able to get character photos with just a couple of minutes wait not long lines. Besides, Street parade is great, best spot is between the Disney castle and street as the parade stopped there for quite a while for static entertainment which only a limited number of people saw.The food selection was good, well priced and there were healthy options. Overall, if you haven't been to a Disney park yet go to this one first."
1598,2016-2,The park is great but if you are going to charge me $$$$ for food you should at least make it better quality than dog food!! Maybe check the rules to see if you can bring some food or snacks with you because you will be disappointed!!
1599,2016-2,"This is a happiest place in the world, when your dreams come true. Hongkong disneyland give their visitor a new excisting not only for kids but adult too. we can spend our time with many attraction and never feel bored. if you hungry they have restaurant around and if you moslem dont worry because they have halal restaurant too in Adventure land, named TAHITIAN RESTO. "
1600,2016-2,"my 3rd visit to hk disney. it's a wonderful place for a one day visit. come here around 10am and have lunch, watch parade, have a rest at the disney dock, come back at night to see the firework. it's one of the best fireworks i have ever seen. it's convenient to take disney line back to city."
1601,2016-2,Hk Disney was amazing! We went on a weekday and had almost no lines! We went on every ride in the park  someEven 5 or 6 times!! The shows were stunning! The food was great! We even got to be the 'first family' and open the park with a golden key! The only line was autopia  so hit that first!! Also  you story land can get a bit congested!
1602,2016-2,"If you are with kids must buy two days pass becoz long queues will consume more time in queues. However, in case of small queues  then one day pass is sufficient."
1603,2016-2,"Disneyland as mentioned, it's a place for young and old. To complete the themepark, I would recommend if you allocated 2 days. I went for a day and only manage to complete 70% with 2 photos sessions. Some few tips & helps on purchasing tickets and entering the theme park. 1 Choose a date where it's non peak season We bought the ticket during the season where not all seasonal ticket holders are allow to entered the theme park. You will be able to check the block out dates at the bottom of the page   Park & Schedule   Park Calendar. 2 Collection of tickets.If you purchased the via online or agent. Head toward the park entrance toward the right and you will be able to find the self machine ticket collection. Just scan the QR code on the printed email and the machine will dispense the tickets.  3 Priority entrance for Disneyland Hotels If you are staying at any Disneyland Hotels, there is a priority queue located at the right side (at the edge of the theme park). You will be able to skip the queue and enter the theme park.  4 Fast Pass for Space Mountain (Roller Coaster) & The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.When you arrive at the theme park, do remember to collect the pass from these 2 rides. With the fast pass you will be allocated to a time slot and skip the queue. Do remember there are limited fast pass per day  5 Disney PhotoPass Plus (Digital download at HK$398)Instead of purchasing individual photos when you take a photo with your favourite Disney Character. You will be able to receive ALL softcopy photos you took around the park. You will be able to customize different borders for up to 14 days upon purchase. Just search for  Disney PhotoPass  in the website to find out more. 6 Firework, Day Parade & Night Parade For Firework, the best place to see it is in front of the sleeping beauty castle. For Day Parade & Night Parade, the best view somewhere near the right (facing the castle) where you will be able to see any incoming and outgoing shows. Reach there early to avoid disappointment. Hope that help."
1604,2016-3,Despite what the majority of the travellers here says   I liked the resort more than the Ocean Park. You have to try the rollercoaster in the Grizzly Gulch!!! Awesome.
1605,2016-3,"Since I brought an 8 year old son in this Hongkong trip, Disneyland Hongkong is a place not to be missed out. It already rained since morning, but we braved our hearts to go. This was our 2nd time to Disneyland, therefore we already knew how to get there. Taking the cute Disneyland train was still a fun experience for younger kids. When we reached there, the entrance queue was short, in fact no queue at all as few people want to come during rainy and cold weather. Anyways, we went in and took the rides that we had not rode on before in our previous trip. A thumbs up to Disneyland. All the rides operated though visitors were few and it rained quite heavily. I could see all the Disney staff wearing raincoats, taking time to smile and greeted us happily. It was good as children felt welcomed. The photo session and parade also went on as normal. However, fireworks was cancelled due to bad weather. We enjoyed our rides in the rain. We had equipped ourselves with raincoats and umbrellas. They also sold raincoats with Disneyland figures, and it was bestseller on that day! We had lunch consisting of chicken, pork and duck rice. The food was good and of big portion, price was expensive! The sitting place was soaked with rain...there was no shelter, only a few big umbrellas overshadowing us and still we could get wet. We did not choose a closed space restaurant as it was the closest to us. I think this could be improved by the management. On our way back, we bought a few souvenirs from the Disney shops. Overall a fun and memorable experience. We would surely go back again, but during a much weather friendly season."
1606,2016-3,Disney Land every where is a great trip and this no exceptionGreat day had by all and you never miss the end of day parade or fireworks.For my young daughter  there is always a little princess in all our daughters.... and this bought out the best.
1607,2016-3,"Living in Florida, USA, this Disney Park was small. I visited on a rainy day and there were very few people there. I was very surprised. The Main Street only had about 3 dozen people on it. It is near the airport, built on reclaimed land, and not near the city. The one good thing was the price. Being a Senior, aged over 65, I paid $22.50US. Compare that to the over $100 in Florida and it was a great value. Saw many cute little dressed up Princess'. Disney is always a fun place to be."
1608,2016-3,"My last visit was in 2011 and since then several more attractions had opened. Though it's not as big as the ones in Japan or USA, it'll still satisfy the curious who wanted to experience the  Disney Magic  for the first time. Queues were not as long so my children were happier (how could you compare 1.5 2 hrs in bigger Disneys to just a measly 10 20 mins when we visited?) . Food venues were plenty and not as expensive as in some theme parks, some offered local delicacies. Souvenirs were plenty as usual and not cheap. To make it exciting for the kiddies, we went tokens hunting (bronze coins flattened and embossed with character from each section of the park). The machines should be located near each souvenir shops, which you can locate in the map. If you need the tokens album, you can purchase in the main store."
1609,2016-3,We went there in rainy day so it wasn't crowded and most of the shows was cancelled it was really small and the crew was rude not helpful and not flexible with young children i will not go there again other Disneyland much more better
1610,2016-3,Went to Disney with my siblings and our kids. Great time! No long lines and we got to ride multiple times. There were more cooler things for adults to do and the selection in the shops were quite extensive too. Kids and adults had a wonderful time. Food:huge servings can be shared. Free drinking fountains Bathrooms can be cleaner. 
1611,2016-3,"i have visit Hong kong Disneyland on the end of January. The weather so cold and windy. so we just tried 2 outdoor attraction. buy ticket online could help you to reduce time to queue at ticket box. tips from me, when you enter the gate, take the attraction map and found some fast track attraction, so you could save queue time and enjoy more attraction. Don't missed the parade! you could find the schedule on the map also.while you're waiting for firework, there is a lot of shop around the Disneyland, and every store may be have different merchandise. Hope you have a wonderful experience as i do."
1612,2016-3,"This is a must from old to the very young. Had Grandkids with us and totally enjoyed all the Characters, activities and the Grand Parade is a MUST........Well organised and you don't have too go the America."
1613,2016-3,My first Disneyland visit! Love it! But it rather small for a theme park attraction. The food were too expensive!
1614,2016-3,"I was surprised it was cheaper to get in than the one in the States, it is much smaller that the American one but still very impressive.  Perfect place for children and if you want to re live your childhood."
1615,2016-3,"We found a Buy 3 get 1 Free ticket promotion online and the prices were the cheapest except that we needed to visit before January 3, 2016. We couldn't make it any other dates except on January 1, 2016 and that day happened to be a busy day for HK Disneyland. We bought a Disneyland PhotoPass package which we thought it was a good deal since we are splitting the cost. But we later realized that we had spent too much time waiting in line to take pictures with the Disneyland characters and that we did not enjoy as many rides as we would like. The park itself is small but we did not have time to walk through the entire park. The fire work show at night was great. Make sure you start saving your spot for this fire work show. The mid day parade was good too. Recommend going early in the day and start enjoying the park."
1616,2016-3,"If you have kids under 10 and if this is your first visit to any of the Disney land, then this is a place of heaven . I travelled with a 9 year old and a 6 year old.We changed our itinerary twice to visit Disneyland because of rains. The excitement started when we were asked to board the Disney land train, quite different from the normal metro trains. I would say the tickets were not as expensive as I thought for the park. You are greeted by Mickey mouse and his spouse : ) at the entrance and are allowed to take few photograph's with them. Our first thing to do was to fill up some energy to walk. ( it is a bigger park by walk and energy boosters are required in frequent intervals). So there you go, spend some money on the turkey, frozen pack popcorns and some energy drinks. We took a copy of the map of the park which contains list of additional scheduled events.I had taken a firm decision on making the kids wait until I completely plan for the day. Though tough task, but at the end of the day we all felt happy for the plan.I am not going to explain you what we did with each game the rest of the day because it differs on every one's interest. But if you have girl kids don't miss the frozen show. The 3d show, the evening parade, cracker show is worth it. Never mind about food or beverages, there are plenty of options. Park is clean and hygienic. Worth the Visit"
1617,2016-3,"Once you get inside, you won't be able to leave. It indeed makes you feel like a little kid all over again. Dining places are great, as well shops and attractions. Orbitron and Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars were a blast."
1618,2016-3,"Disneyland in Hong Kong is a perfect place for all ages, lots of rides and shows on stage, great food and atmosphere. we have been there at lease 10 times over last 3 years and still like to go more."
1619,2016-3,"having been a plenty of times, a definite change of staff attitude (gosh, where's the  smile you are on stage  disappeared to) and a drop in quality is very visible. Very disappointing. Throughout most of early 2015 it's been every time fantastic. polite, friendly staff, great access to the characters and most rides open. After September 2015 there's been a clear decline on all levels; prices went up; attractions keep being closed or removed (why the hell would you stop the Frozen experience if that is still such a success and so many merchandise things are still so popular   the area it had been in, is now empty anyways?!? So you get less for more money. very disappointing. "
1620,2016-3,Visited here on a weekend to my regret. The place was crowded to capacity with long queues for attractions of over an hour. Would recommend mid week visits though I must say Disney did not disappoint with the afternoon parade taking centre stage as usual
1621,2016-3,A place which every kid wants to visit. A place which every person will love to experience. Beautiful and energetic. Lovely rides and arrangement. Note: Go weekends and wait for fireworks at closing time. The tickets are cheaper if you purchase from airport itself. The goodies are extremely expensive. Reserve the entire day for it.
1622,2016-3,"We went to Hong Kong Disneyland on a rainy morning and was surprised to see few visitors! With only few visitors, lines were short (wait time of 5mins or less) and we were able to watch all major shows and ride on all major rides. Luckily for us, the rain stopped in the afternoon, which allowed us to see the parade and fireworks."
1623,2016-3,"I love the parade, i love the firework, i love everything about disney.The best place to take young children there because they're always amazed. It's so lovely to see them smile and laugh.Best way to get to HK Disneyland is by MTR. It has a special train decorated a la Disney, such as Mickey Mouse windows and handles.The jungle river is the best ride in HK Disney. I love it very much. Full of surprise though."
1624,2016-3,This is the best place in town for who wish to visit the dreamland with the reality of being a child's fantasies.Enjoy kids with various rides and attractions that also suitable for adults.I love this place for you can the personalities who places in our TV alive.
1625,2016-4,Disney Hong Kong great for my 7 year old daughter. Smaller than Florida but still had Disney quality. Ques not as long due to rainy weather but we didn't mind. Staff friendly. Downside was the food. Yuk! Awful fast food. Didn't eat it.
1626,2016-4,"My family (six adults) visited this in January 2016. We had a good day. We have visited this resort several times in the past, and it is still improving. The  small world  attraction was a highlight and was worth the entrance price alone. The queues were not too bad (we came on a Monday). However we were in the queue for the mining roller coaster was about 45 minutes. It is difficult to find any western food at the resort. Next time we visit this resort will bring a picnic lunch."
1627,2016-4,Disneyland Hongkong is great for Kids (or Big Kids) but it lacks the roller coasters of other Disneylands that keep the adults entertained.  The Lion King show is a definate highlight.
1628,2016-4,It was cold when we went there so we enjoyed roaming around.  The rides are great and fun.  It was just sad that we were not able to see the parade and fireworks because it rained.    Will go back if we get the chance :)
1629,2016-4,We got to Disneyland quite late so didn't have enough time to do much but the 1 ride & 1 house we did go in were brilliant and the Parade was really good & we missed the out of this world firework display so were gutted until we return next time... 
1630,2016-4,"Thank God for Disneyland   and of course thank Walt Disney too.The tag    Happiest Place on Earth    can truly be experienced when visiting a Disneyland Park anywhere in the world.I happened to visit Hong Kong Disneyland Park last Saturday (Jan 30) with 3 of my friends.Since it   s a weekend, naturally the park is teeming with crowd a lot of them families with small children wearing cute Disney character costume.Queue to a ride can be up to over an hour so be prepared. They provide express pass at extra cost.Compared to other theme parks, we grew up with Disney. We know all the Disney characters so there is an acquired love to start with.And seeing some of these characters walking in the park makes you reminisce your childhood days.Most of the rides are really for children and not extreme but adults can still enjoy.The price of food and beverage is pricey (as expected with most theme parks). One set meal with burger, fries and drinks would cost around HKD 99 (approx THB 500) a meal with rice can cost around HKD 129 (approx THB 600) though the serving size is not big. There are variety of restaurants serving different kinds of menu to choose from.We were able to catch the parade in the afternoon and the new Paint the Night parade around 7:30pm. It was truly a magical night when all the characters paraded in colorful LED lights. Every one enjoyed (including me) and not only the kids. Just be there 10 15 minutes before the parade as it gets really crowded especially on a weekend and you may not land a good spot to have a good view of the parade.Be sure to stay until the fireworks (around 9:00 pm). Disneyland is accessible by MTR. For guests staying in any of the Disney Hotels, they offer free shuttle bus service until midnight from the park to the hotel and vice versa."
1631,2016-4,"My wife and I went to Disneyland on Thursday, January 28, 2016. The cost of the entrance is worth every penny. Even at the train station you can already feel the Disney ambience with the Mickey Mouse themed train. All the shows that we watched were amazing. Lion King, the musical play where I saw disney princesses like Elsa, Brave, & Rapunzel from tangled sing, It's a small world ride show. I loved the afternoon and evening parades, toy story land, grizzly ride, river ride, etc. The most spectacular among all was the fire works above the castle. It was really similar to the opening scene in every Disney movie. I could never imagine myself being there in person as it was only a dream when I was a child. Thank you Disney for bringing the characters to life and sharing this experience to us."
1632,2016-4,"We pre bought our tickets on line so getting in was a little faster. It was a fine day and lots of people, had to line up for rides about 30 min. There was lots to see and do we were there from morning till night, Saw the fireworks, the train from Disney came regularly on closure of the park so there was no need to rush out."
1633,2016-4,We enjoyed our day here but I recommend that you take your family   great day for small children   they will have a ball.  We went as a couple and still enjoyed our time there.
1634,2016-4,Disneyland in Hong Kong is comparable to the one in Paris and has everything that a Disney fan seeks. The place is easily accessible via MTR and is a visual treat. The parade's are worth the wait and the fireworks at the end of the evening is also impressive. A good place to take your kids and also relive your childhood.
1635,2016-4,"Visited on a Monday and spent the whole day here. There was a minimal crowd, place was small enough that we could walk around the entire park and many rides repeatedly. The longest Q was for the Autopia. It was a 30 minutes wait for our first ride during lunch hours. We came back in the evening, and there were no lines.Downside was that at least 2 of the F&B areas restaurants were closed.We also missed the new  Mickey and the Wondrous Book  show as we planned our trip using an outdated DisneyHK flyer picked up at the airport. So, best to download latest details from the website itself."
1636,2016-4,"The park is situated far away from the city, which is usual for such a big amusement park, however due to good transport system in place the travel time is not a problem in fact makes the excitement grow into your system. A bit disappointed with the main characters not being available for meet n greet through out the day. The parade and fire show makes it a memorable to finish the day at the park. The park has good food options with great rides and great park entertainments to keep you pumped up through out the day."
1637,2016-4,"As you would expect there is not a leaf out of place everything is preened within an inch of it's life but a fantastic day, the tickets are pricey and take out a mortgage to buy a drink ($8.50 Australian 500ml in Australia 600 ml $3.00) and let's not even talk about the food and souvenirs prices."
1638,2016-4,"This place is a complete package for family fun , not so much for thrill seekers(go to ocean park).  They have got some nice attractions for kids and young families."
1639,2016-4,"Most of the rides were pretty usual rides found in most parks. Adults will find the park boring, the kids will like most of the rides."
1640,2016-4,"I brought an 8 year old and a 16 year old, and both girls loved it.I was a little cold during the period we were there (Jan 21) but it was still pleasant. Loads of people poured out of the train as we went about 20 minutes before the park opened. Most people were already queuing in line, but as we had our  e tickets  from Klook, the instructions to find a  magic window  was incorrect. We simply had to queue with the rest, and the staff at the gate will convert the e ticket into a normal pass.The rides were simple and safe. Some rollercoasters were a little scary for the girls, but in the end, we went for a second round on the scariest we could find (RC Racer and Mine Cars at Grizzly Gulch).Food is available all around, but a little too much Asian cuisine for an American Theme Park. The merchandise was sufficiently varied, and the staff all put on a good show. We didn't get to see the parades (evening parade cancelled due to weather) but the Fireworks was worth the wait (With a mad dash for the trains the moment it ended).Overall, the queues were never very long (10mins at the most) with most clearing in a few minutes. It was worth a visit, but for my older boys, this would not have been a thrill for them.Tip: Go before 10, and stay until the fireworks appear"
1641,2016-4,"Disneyland has always been a dream & we finally got to see on our 10 Wedding Anniversary in Hong Kong with our 4 year old son. Coincidentally, Disney was also celebrating their 10th Anniversary   which we weren't aware of till we got there. It was a cold day & had mild showers in the morning so we initially thought it was gonna be not very pleasant experience but little did we know that Disney doesn't stop for any reason!! When we got to Disney it was beaming with people and they were selling raincoats, the rides, shows, parades, characters were all running on schedule & infact once the rains stopped the staff & helpers bent backwards to ensure it was dry & as lovely as always! Disney truly is a magical place!!!! "
1642,2016-4,"A useful day trip, especially for those with children. Great rides and 3d shows. Every Sunday, there's a parade with music. Close to the HK Airport."
1643,2016-4,"Got my ticket thru hong kong disneyland website. It was 10% cheaper and includEd a food voucher worth 130 hk$. Spend my morning at citygate outlet for shopping and luunch which was cheaper and better. Proceeded to disneyland by 2pm. This time it was cold with Fewer people than usual. Went around main street then space mountain and buzz lightyear astroblaster. Proceeded to flight of fancy parade. Proceeded to Mickey and the Wondrous book, this is a new show. Festival of the lion king then Disney point the night parade where you see the characters in lighted custumes on lighted floats, very high tech. The night is capped by disney in the star fireworks at 8:15 pm, this is so far the best i have seen, that is more than 15 times in 10 years. Music is the same, but the fireworks had depth dimension, with gold stars streaming to the sky, it also added video projected on sleeping beaty castle that are sink to fireworks and music. It was WOW, as you can hear from the viewers. By the way, i travel via mrt, red tsuen wan line to lai king, transfer to tung chung line to sunny bay then to disney line, skipping the long long walk at the central station. I also used the one day pass, so that i can visit mong kok night market after disneyland and still use it the next day all within 24 hours. The cold weather made a lot of difference in the walk."
1644,2016-4,I am a Disney fan. Let me start by saying that! And I have been to all the parks except Tokyo (and soon to be built Shanghai). I am a HK local and LOVE this place. Please don't compare to other parks though or you may be disappointed. It is much much smaller than any other park. But if you let it stand on its own I think you will love it. There are some world exclusive rides   Mystic Manor and Big Grizzly Mountain   which are truly magical. Disney's attention to detail and ability to tell a story are not forgotten here.
1645,2016-4,A definite when visiting HongKong...magnificent and 10yr anniversary of true spectacular showing of the night parade and fireworks to finish the evening...maintains standard in disney to be proud of :)
1646,2016-5,"We had planned the trip to Disneyland thinking that our kids will enjoy here,but we were happy to discover that even us (the ADULTS) enjoyed equally ,if not more!!We used the MTR to reach disneyland .We took a 2 day pass and on day 1 went there for half a day (after we did Ngong ping), and then on day 2 went for 1 full day. We had 2 kids (9 and 6) with us and we felt that 2whole days herewould have been better. Did lots of rides, visited all the sections but missed a few shows. My Girls loved Fantasyland the most, My fav was Adventureland and my husband liked tomorrowland the best. There is a place that serves ok indian food (few options ) inside... Tahitian terrace (not sure abt the name though).Saw a few shows, Lion king show was breathtaking.At the end of 2nd day, we were wanted a few more hrs!!"
1647,2016-5,"I've been to three Disney parks so far, in Orlando, Tokyo and Hong Kong. All are good in their own ways but I really loved Hong Kong Disneyland. I visited with some friends who had never been to a Disney park before and I think this one was a great introduction. It's definitely on the small side but the expansions recently added are fantastic and offer experiences you won't find anywhere else. We went on a weekday and it was super quiet and relaxed. The cast members were all so nice, constantly giving us stickers, and the attention to detail is definitely there. Mystic Manor was probably the highlight, with amazing effects that my friends loved. The Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars were also a hit, but try not to ride if it's raining heavily or you'll look like you've come off Splash Mountain! Toy Story Land was also fun but the rides have quite a low capacity and I think it would be good to have Toy Story Mania here as well. Adventureland definitely suffers without Pirates. Fantasyland was a lot of fun, my only criticism was that the Philharmagic film reel looked quite dated and in need of a clean. Tomorrowland's Space Mountain was a bit of a squeeze for the tall guys in our group, but it's a fun roller coaster that's more conventional and less  wild mouse  than the other parks. The Buzz Lightyear ride kept breaking down unfortunately, but Stitch Encounter was great fun. There were characters everywhere and the meet and greets were well organized, unlike in Japan. Food was expensive and a bit variable, but the Explorer's Club Restaurant was amazing. I think it might be closed on certain days though. The fireworks were really enjoyable and everyone in my group had a wonderful time. This is a fun, relaxed Disneyland that is definitely worth a visit now that the new expansions are open and I hope to visit again if they add more attractions!"
1648,2016-5,"I am a Disney Fanatic, I only have Japan left to visit and I will have been to all the parks currently in the world. Hong Kong Disneyland is small! You do not need long to do the park and therefore it is a weigh up as to whether you would like to get there when it opens and avoid all the queues, or go later and hang around for the fireworks. Hong Kong Disneyland does however have all the magic that a Disney park should have. The decor and atmosphere is great. Would definitely recommend a visit."
1649,2016-5,"We have been to the Original Disneyland in LA and to Disney World parks in Orlando so this one was a bit of a let down as it was a lot smaller but still every bit as much Disney. What spoilt it for us was the cold weather and rain but the kids still enjoyed themselves. A lot quieter which was great, no horrendous lines like the other two parks. Food prices and souvenirs though were absolutely ridiculously expensive and although the other parks are pricey, they have nothing on Hong Kong, but then everything in HK is crazy expensive. Hardly saw any disney characters walking around like in the usual parks which was disappointing. Enjoyed the Toy Story land which was something new that we hadn't seen in the other parks. Very well done. The night parade was really great, but we were so cold it was hard to enjoy it."
1650,2016-5,"My husband and I enjoyed HK Disney, but were surprised that there are only two high speed adult rides (and even those weren't that thrilling). Unless you are with kids, dont waste time standing in queues for Tomorrowland's go carts or Its a Small World. The parade was really great (it started at 3pm) and I loved the colourful Toy Story theme!!"
1651,2016-5,I consider easy access to Disney as one of the perks we get for living in Lantau Island. The park is not big but that makes it easy for us to get around. I started bringing our now 22 month old daughter since she was 9 months and she loved it since then. Here are the attractions without height restrictions that my daughter enjoyed:FantasylandThis is the area most suitable for babies  toddlers. 1) Cinderella carousel2) Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (queues are always long so better get a fast pass)3) Mickey's Philharmagic Orchestra 4) Dumbo5) Mad hatter's tea cup6) Small WorldTomorrowland1) Buzz Lightyear Astro Blaster2) OrbitronAdventureland1) Jungle river cruise (some parts of the ride can be scary or too loud)2) watch the lion king show (amazing!)Mystic Point1) Mystic Manor (might scary for young children)Toy story Land1) slinky dogThere's an afternoon and night parade in mainstreet USA everyday. 
1652,2016-5,"My 4 and 7 year olds both had a blast at Disneyland hk. The park is so well maintained and most of the rides and attractions are good for both those age groups so both my kids thoroughly enjoyed themselves. Beware food, popcorn and ice cream are overpriced inside the park and food from outside is not allowed. But this was quite expected. "
1653,2016-5,"Disney land is a must visit for people of all ages as it will transport you back to your childhood. There is so much to do, so much to see. Best to keep two days for Disney. Long queues for the rides even on week days. Dont miss the parade."
1654,2016-5,There's a lot of people at the park and waiting time for rides can be quite Long. The park is not that huge and can be covered within a couple of hours.
1655,2016-5,"Loved our visit to Disneyland Hong Kong. We were lucky enough to be chosen as the family to open the park and it 2as such a thrill. Meet and greet with Mickey, Minnie, Donald and Winnie. It was too rainy the day we went, so missed the princess meet and greet. I took other reviewers advice and we only bought tickets for 1 day and stayed in HK Island. Biggest regret, time over with a four year old in tow, I would stay at the resort, and buy a two day pass. We barely left Fantasyland, and the rain set in so had to leave. Its small but for a fi4st time visitor to the Disney parks it was great."
1656,2016-5,To visit disneyland you have to spare one full day to enjoy all the attraction and don't miss the parade and fireworks. Take weekdays visit not weekend.
1657,2016-5,We have three boys aged 10yrs and Twins aged 8yrs. I thought the older boy would find this place boring but just to see his face light up when we got on the Disney train was magical!! They absolutely loved it! The rides at tomorrow land was their favourite but a word of warning about one particular ride   SPACE MOUNTAIN   it is a roller coaster ride in the complete DARK   do not listen to staff who say it is not scarey   it is TERRIFYING and gave our kid nightmares. So be warned!!
1658,2016-5,"First time going to disneyland, we went on monday but it was fully packed    taking an autopia ride took an hour to queue"
1659,2016-5,I managed to visit where it is not too crowded. Not too bad. Just sad that it was raining when I was there. Fireworks is a little different as compared to when I visited back in 2008.
1660,2016-5,Walked all the way to Mystic Manor and discovered is not available. Park shall have some sign board around the park to provide information on the availability and also waiting time for each ride.
1661,2016-5,"Visited Disney to watch my daughter who is Elsa in Mickeys Wonderous Book. What an amazing experience Disney is. The shows are nothing short of perfect with obvious time and expense to set them up. As you would expect the rest of the park is fabulous. The rides and attractions are incredible. The lines can be long at times but seem to move through reasonably fast. Don't just spend the afternoon, plan to make it a full day trip. Food is a bit expensive. Great day with or without kids."
1662,2016-5,Was nice to get a touch of Disney and it is traditional Disney feeling too.  Not as big as others in all ways (including the castle) but it gave us the touch of Disney we craved.
1663,2016-5,"I went on a sunday, due to the low temperature, there wasnt much people.The rides are mostly empty and its boring, no trill rides, no roller coaster. Really a dreamland for the young amd young at heart. Every food and drink is double the price of whats sold outside.Toilets are clean"
1664,2016-5,We spent the day here before flying out of Hong Kong in the evening and it worked very well since there is luggage storage at the gates.It's a smaller park than in the USA and can easily be done in a day. Long queues for the Autopia ride (who knew) but most of the thrilling rides we walked right onto.A really enjoyable day.
1665,2016-5,Very good experiance. We want to go there again and again.  Disneyland is Like heaven for childrens..childrens are enjoying all of rides..  Specially new years carnival is superb.
1666,2016-5,"We have not been to a Disney park in over ten years. This is a much smaller park, but it was fun to just stroll through the different sections, take in the shows, and experience the rides. It's not the latest and greatest amusement park, but you get to experience Disney, and the price was great.Easy access via the metro system. Purchased tickets and meal coupon online. Biggest disappointment was Small World closed until February. Lion King was a great show!"
1667,2016-6,"Renowned name but almost like an average amusement park to me.If they are famous for renowned cartoon characters, also they will be criticized for non systematic arrangement of rides and showing characters for photography with the visitors. All the characters are standing on their different points at the same time. How one person can take more than one photograph with the characters at the same time? They are standing on different places which are far one from another.Well appointed park.Nice parade on two times.But entry fees are too expensive."
1668,2016-6,"Happiest Place on Earth. Fun day for all ages, it wasn't very busy when we visited not a lot of wait time. Fireworks were a great end to the night."
1669,2016-6,"Parade, shows and Fireworks are amazing. We visited Disneyland on Jan1 2016 and had an amazing time in start of the new year. We managed to ride most of the attractions. Great place to visit."
1670,2016-6,"its my second time to visit this park, but still never fails to amaze me. entrance fee at 539 hkd. 500 ml water at 28hkd. everythings too pricey though. if u get too tired to walk u can ride the train."
1671,2016-6,"This is the must go theme park in Hong Kong. They have expanded since 2005, but you can still enjoy most of the rides in 1 day during the low season on a week day.TIPS: Try to go on a week day to avoid the crowd.The Disney theme starts on the MTR train before you even get there."
1672,2016-6,"Me and my wife had a memorable start of the year time here! As expected, as it is a Holiday (Jan, 1 2016) the crowd was big. But after a good planning strategy, we've manage to visit (and ride!) all the attractions in a day! We're there from opening to closing..Photo selfie with the mascots..River Cruise is awesome. Tarzan tree house is cool! Lion King Festival is excellent. Day and Night Parades..Mystic Manor..too many to mention...Over all, it's truly will bring out a child in everyone!"
1673,2016-6,We went there with our 5 yr old daughter. She liked it so much. The staff were friendly and helpful. Don't miss the fireworks and Disney's Storybook Theater. It was entertaining.
1674,2016-6,One of the must to visit in Hong Kong. Disneyland is best for kids and kids a like. Me and my wife really enjoy all the rides. At first we though that the rides are boring and just for kids. But when we ride it was fun and exciting. I suggest to try all the rides as possible to get the full experience of Disney Land. 
1675,2016-6,"This Disney park is the least interesting of all Disneylands in the world, and also the smallest one. It caters only for the youngest ones, with almost no rides and thrills for older.  Far better option is the Ocean Park (see my review for it)."
1676,2016-6,"It's the happiest place on earth. Unfortunately because of the weather the cancel few events. The que was unbearable tho, may be because of the peak season. But hey it's Disneyland, need I say more?"
1677,2016-6,A very average Disney. This is our third visit and whilst incredibly convenient if you live in this region this is not a great Disney. It is quite small and overrun with rude tourists who have no manners. They push shove and cut lines which can become infuriating after awhile. The food is also abominable. We were there for 5 days and on the last day we really couldn't face eating more slop. All that said our 4 year old still loves it. Disney is Disney. But I doubt we will be back. The Disney is Japan is incomparably better. 
1678,2016-6,"My wife had never been to a Disney park, and I hadn't been since I was 6. We were living near this one, and decided to go with a friend and her 4 year old. I can't compare to other Disney parks, but it was much better than most amusement parks I've been to. Obviously, the little one wanted to see all of the characters, but I was amazed at how sweet and kind the characters were, especially Ariel and Elsa. We rode a few rides, including the Jungle Cruise and Space Mountain. The little one did not like either (too scary), but my wife and I enjoyed both. (However, I think someone might want to update Jungle Cruise somehow, because there was some seriously racist stuff in there. Also, the  dime store Indian  on Main Street was also racist.) After Space Mountain, i thought nothing would be able to top it. However, then we saw the final parade and the fireworks. I'm not big on either parades or fireworks, but these were amazing. The parade featured characters in amazing get ups, as well as dancing, lights, and music. The fireworks we done to Disney and Chinese music, and included scenes displayed on Cinderella's castle. My wife and I were holding each other during it, and it really was (as much as I hate to use the word) magical.Food was eh, but service every single place was outstanding. We plan on going again before leaving the area."
1679,2016-6,"We had a full day at Disneyland from opening until 7.30pm you need to do this so you are able to see the street parades the evening one is spectacular with all of the lighting. The various rides and attractions were enjoyed by all these are included in your entry fee, as is The Lion King show which is very worth seeing, everything else in there is expensive including the food outlets they are not the best. All in all a great family day out."
1680,2016-6,"Still an amazing place even though I can not enjoy all the attraction, there is a parade on certain time. Shopping here quite expensive and the food is decent."
1681,2016-6,"We had a great fun visiting the Hong Kong Disneyland on January 14, 2016 (Thursday) while being in Hong Kong for a day between connecting flights from Russia to Australia. The weather was perfect, not too cold, not too hot. There were not many people that day at all, the longest we had to wait for a ride was 20 minutes, and many had no waiting time at all, or only 5 minutes. Best rides that we enjoyed the most were Space Mountain (went three times) and Mystique Manor (went two times). For both of those there were no waiting times. Had great fun. Caught taxi both ways from and to the international airport. It was a good option for us as there were three of us and we were charged $130HK on the way to Disneyland and $100HK on the way back. The ride took about twenty minutes. So all up, it was a great way to break up a very long journey home from visiting family in Russia."
1682,2016-6,"We decided to go on 2 Jan which was a Saturday due to rainy weather predicted for rest of the week. Got tickets from CTS office day before which was discounted. Got to Disneyland before 10 am, opening time. As soon as we were allowed in, we went to fetch the fast pass for Space Mountain and then proceeded straight to the grizzly gultch roller coaster and then to mystic manor ride. Due to getting there early, there were no queues for these 2 rides. We then proceeded to the parachute ride, and U rides which the kids enjoyed and then in time for Space mountain roller coaster which was very enjoyable. It's a Small World ride was also very enjoyable. Shows not to be missed where Mickeys philamagic show, lion king and mickey story book show. Lines for these are quite long so try and get there early. The river boat ride was also very enjoyable. The parades were quite nice but viewing was difficult due to the crowds. Food was overpriced and bad. Overall a fun filled day with the family."
1683,2016-6,"Good fun but it is a small Disney park, we had most rides done in a day, the lines were not big and the staff were friendly. Food and drink over priced but that's what you expect"
1684,2016-6,"My family (2 adults, 2 kids and baby) had a two day pass and we used our time as best as we could. We were staying at Disneyland Hotel so we took he shuttle bus to the park each day and used the hotel entrance line which was quick and easy. Highlight for me was the Lion King show, do not miss! Quite a few ride options for our 12 year old and 9 year old. Plenty of places to eat and grab snacks. Queues were orderly, although long at times. Fireworks were lovely. Had a great couple of days!"
1685,2016-6,"It is very clean, well maintained and not too crowded. The parade is exceptional and my kid (and I) loves it. You can save some money by buying your entry & meal ticket online at discounted price.I wish there are more rides available for kids aged 5 & under. One of the attractions is under maintenance. I only took photos with Mickey, Minnie and Donald. Can't spot Pluto and Goofy at all."
1686,2016-6,"This is the second time we've been to the Disneyland in Hong Kong. The first time was 2 years ago. Since then we've been to the Tokyo Disneyland. In comparison, the Hong Kong Disneyland is small and somewhat limited. Food option are less exciting and rides and attractions are smaller and less in quantity. Merchandise were expensive (as expected) but also limited compared to Tokyo's one. This time round, there were less people so it was at least more enjoyable.  Disney Paint the Night  was my personal favourite. Fireworks is at 9pm which is rather late but if you are on holidays you can perhaps afford to allow the children to stay up late. Don't try to prepare your day by using any information they provide online because the online information is just not up to date. A bit frustrating to have planned our day according to their information just to find that the plan was not going to be helpful. We recommend if you wish to stay for the fireworks to arrive just before noon so you have enough energy by the time the fireworks start. If you intend to go to Ocean Park and Disneyland, there are some discount for purchasing both park tickets if you hold a foreign passport. It worked out to be a saving of $99 HKD for adult and $59 HKD for child"
1687,2016-6,It's for young families  it's tired meaning a small world was closed for our visit it's not friendly at all found the model of Disneyland has not kept up at all
1688,2016-7,"What a fantastic day we had! This was my third Disneyland visit (after Anaheim and Orlando) but probably my favourite! It is a smaller park but no less magical. We went during the week and the wait for rides was next to nothing! Fur characters and classic rides like the teacups and carousel seem to be more a favourite with locals as these attractions had the longest wait times. There were 2 parades with the night one being the most spectacular. Fireworks were also very impressive with the story displayed on the castle. Only two rides have Fastpass, space mountain and a pooh bear ride. I bought our tickets beforehand on klook which I highly recommend doing because we were able to go right up to the turnstile and they were cheaper. We also bought food vouchers on klook which gave us lunch, dinner and a snack. We stayed at Disney the whole day and were able to do most rides, see both parades, fireworks and all the characters we wanted to. If you wanted to do everything plus the two stage shows I would think you would need a two day ticket. I would go back in a second! Have fun!! "
1689,2016-7,"January is cold in this part of the country, which can be also an advantage as you walk the whole day to the park & conclude it at night with the fireworks at castle. Better book early if you want to stay in their hotels, it easily get full specially during this season. The place offers lots of of interest point for all ages (as long as you fit to walk) and it even have some free drinking fountain in some points."
1690,2016-7,"No matter if you've never been to Disney or you've been to every park around the world, Disney always finds a way to make you have a magical visit!I've been to Disney World more times than I can count, and to Tokyo Disney, and I was so happy to come. Although it's the smallest park, they have special shows not found in other parks and unique twists on some of the classic rides. (I'm not spoiling anything for you!) You have more than enough to do in one day. Disney always delivers quality rides, entertainment, food, and customer service. I also enjoyed trying new Asian foods and snacks at this park. Thanks for making another special Disney memory for us! "
1691,2016-7,Coincidently this year is the 10th anniversary of HK Disneyland. It was too crowded but luckily we were able to enjoy the Parades and fireworks.
1692,2016-7,"very disapionting unfriendy staff ,take pics of you even askif its free them say yes yes inend you find out you need topayanyway wait wait everywhere about 60 min to go withyour child inside some disney atraction .nobody care you or your child cold faces no kindniss buttomline disney verydisapionting "
1693,2016-7,"We had a two day ticket for Disneyland Hong Kong, but probably could've left it at one day. The park wasn't as big as we had expected. However, it was a quiet day with a little bit of rain, so, we may have just been lucky that we got around all of the attractions and rides easily. We didn't wait any longer than five minutes for anything. "
1694,2016-7,"Cant go wrong with Disneyland if you're traveling with kids. My son loved Toy Storyland so much we almost spent our entire day there. Got my discounted tickets from Klook and it was so easy to redeem from the automated machines. The only downside is that food inside is expensive but so so. Still, it was a happy visit for our family :)"
1695,2016-7,This park is quite small compared to Anaheim. Go early as we had a maximum wait of 10 mins for space mountain and walked onto most other rides until about 12.30pm. Lines still weren't massive after this. We went Wednesday.Still has the disneyland feel but don't expect to spend all day there. Good for younger children or if you have a day to kill. Took a cab for convenience $180hkd one way.
1696,2016-7,"Make sure you have sufficient time in your hand (atleast 2 days), specially if you are travelling with kids. Adult people can have few attractions along with rides also and most importantly don't miss the Roadshows and Fireworks in the evening."
1697,2016-7,The happiest place on earth ! Smaller than other Disney Lands but it's always great fun ! I love the Lion King show and the parades . The night parade is always popular. Bring a padlock for your pushchair though !
1698,2016-7,"Had a very wonderful visit at the Disneyland here in Hong Kong. My only complain is the distance it is from the city. It takes a while to get there using the train with many train switches. It's not too big but it offers many rides. The rides are not as fun as other recreational parks, but hey I am spoiled from Australia's Dreamworld. Take your kids here, they'll love you for it and have a wonderful time. "
1699,2016-7,"Had a ball. Definitely need two days to experience this place. The staff can't do enough to help you. Very clean. Shows are amazing, especially the night parade. Expensive,  but to be expected.  Fun for all ages."
1700,2016-7,"Good place to bring children for quality time, fun and enjoyment. Rides and attractions were great for kids. Food have improved compare to earlier years."
1701,2016-7,"This park had it all to give us another taste of Disney. Our last Disney trip was 30 years ago in LA and the fun started once again. We now have the Disney bug and will head for Japan to experience it again on our next tripDont wait, let the kid out in you once again in the clean organised Hong Kong fun park. We went during the week and had enough time in one day to see it all with the longest wait only 10 minutes"
1702,2016-7,"My friends and I did not stay for the fireworks, nor did we took all the rides in the amusement park. But, we enjoyed ourselves a lot too! There are so many souvenirs you can buy in the shops! Avoid the holidays so that you will not have to queue too long for the rides."
1703,2016-7,"I had reached that part of the holiday where you had seen everything and need to anxiety to find something to do creeps in. Decided to go to Disneyland to waste some time. Went on a weekday where it was raining in the morning. Crowds initially were very minimal (I arrived at 12pm) but as the day progressed as the prospect of rain decreased, crowds started to appear. I used my hotel's 'Handy' phone to purchase discounted tickets which allowed me to bypass the ticket waiting queue and enter straight into the park after scanning my prepurchased ticket. It was nice to see the park had expanded since i last went and my favourite two chicken and chips still available. However coffee from the mobile kiosk outside the main castle tasted horrible! Fortunately, I did not see an PRC antics of pushing in (contrary to what other tripadvisor reviewers had experienced) but that could be because lines were pretty short. The night parade was unfortunately cancelled due to the rain that had swept through and hour before the parade was to start, and consequently made the decision to go home before the fireworks :("
1704,2016-7,"What can be said about Disneyland which has not been said already. It makes even adults want to be kids again and enjoy their fantasies they had while growing up. The grand entrance to the place, The special train with open bogeys, the rides, the parade with their signature characters, fireworks all makes it a great place to take kids. It is however smaller version of the one they have in the US and can be completed in a day. Even then it is a must go and get lost in a fantasyland.Tips for Indian Vegetarians: They serve Indian Vegetarian food in Tahitian terrace in Disneyland."
1705,2016-7,"They have added more rides and attractions,in the 10 years they have been open. It is much cleaner than Disneyland in Los Angeles, and also a more affordable vacation option for Asians,Indians,Australians, Pacific Islanders,and everyone else in the region."
1706,2016-7,"Most of the attractions here are for kids (which I am not), so I spent most of the time walking around looking for something fun to do. I eventually settled on a good restaurant. What I did enjoy were the shows and parade of disney characters, otherwise I would highly recommend it to anyone with kids. "
1707,2016-7,"We had perfect visit here, the sun was shining and the temperature was just perfect. I have had people tell me that Hong Kong Disney is not as big or good as the other Disney's around the world. Well I have not visited any of those so I can't compare, but we thoroughly enjoyed our day and would say also its not  just for kids  it for big kids too , like me!!. People who say its just for kids must be too scared to try the thrill rides, and so they didn't get the full benefit. The thrill rides are scream worthy!! and well worth it. Just seeing the young children enjoying themselves is nice too. If you are thinking of going , I would say GO!! but go early before the crowds, and for the adults just let yourself go and enjoy being a kid again. its a great stress reliever. I would definitely visit again. PS.. you need a full day here."
1708,2016-7,"My wife is a Disney addict and I like a bit of Mickey Mouse myself even though we are in our fifties. We enjoyed HK Disneyland four years ago and probably liked it even more this time. We saw the day time big parade and the evening light imbued parade, both were great. We did the new Grisley Gulch mountain ride which I found terrifying. My wife was a legend at the Buzz Light year shoot out ride   have a go, it is fun. The food in the Hawaiian eatery was quite reasonable but the Main St Cafe was very ordinary. It is great to see how much the Asian culture gets into Disney, middle aged men sang the old M I C K E Y theme as the parades were conducted. It is a lovely day out with no adult themes, violence or unpleasant themes which plague so much of our entertainment these days."
1709,2016-8,"My 2.5yo daughter and I absolutely loved it. She's not old enough to do a lot of rides so what we were able to do there was quite good for her age already.Would love to go back just to take photos with the princesses and see the parade and fireworks which unfortunately we missed out on. The parade was cancelled due to poor weather, and consequently the 7.30pm fireworks as well. My kids couldn't stay up till the 9pm ones so we went back to the hotel and called it a day. "
1710,2016-8,"It's not only for kids adults can also enjoy this amazing magical place full of happiness, it is now the 10 anniversary and the celebrations are more special attended the parade and it was wonderful loved everything in this world"
1711,2016-8,"New areas added fm my last visit   toy story land, mystic point, and grizzly gulch. Added rides were great BUT do not pass on the shows! Particularly lion king and the storybook theater! Storybook theater effects were magical. Makes it worth every buck you spent! Try not to miss out on fireworks too. "
1712,2016-8,If you have never b sen before in one of Disney Park maybe this is a one day experience to be ok but if you have visited other Disney Park you will be disappointed. It is a nice place to spend a couple of hours if you have very young kids other than that I would highly recommend not to go instead go to Ocean Park.
1713,2016-8,"It's really funny and unexpected. I'm afraid of roller coaster but the big grizzly mountain roller coaster was really excited and made me so happy. Fast and goes backward, that's all. Yes, this ride goes backward, please well prepared! The most exciting part will be happened at the last round, very very fast!"
1714,2016-8,"Magical places for imagination. 1 day is not enough. You probably need at least 2 days to explore and enjoy everything. Join activity with your kids. The late activity was superb. kids love the parade and the main attraction for us is the fireworks, full of colors and imagination. Excellent !!!!"
1715,2016-8,Ok experience. Very expensive.  Probably worth going elsewhere.   Have been to most other Disneyland and this seems very expensive.
1716,2016-8,"We went to Disneyland during our 10 day stay in Hong Kong. The day started out cool and cloudy but after some rain it was an amazing clear blue sky which made the night parade even more spectacular.Our day was chosen after the schools went back so there weren't big crowds and this made it very easy to move around. The shows that were included in the price were amazing especially The Lion King. So make a point of choosing your shows and move around the themed areas accordingly.I would highly recommend it for all ages, and go on some rides too!"
1717,2016-8,"I am a 44yr old woman with two teenager kids but I feel I am a little girl inside whenever I see Disneyland or hear about it .it was my 4th visit to hongkong Disneyland and I yearn for more .i literally transform into a kid when I reach at the entrance of the gate.go for the rides,museums inside or walk on the streets it's magic magic magic all the way!maddening crowds,small kids ,elderlies,young men,women who us not there.Go grab a ticket to the magic land!They have fantasyland,adventure land ,tomorrow land,mystic land,wonderland ,us main street etc.etc.if you cover 1 4th of the plCe fully you are a winner because after walking to this huge property you feel tired so go for the food every land has it's own set of restaurants and cafes although high prove for everything is guaranteed.but to have fun and magic under one roof you have to pay a handsome price.i loved it's a small wonder,mystic ride ,miners and grizzly bears' ride,mickey's philanthropic orchestra and many more rides and covered almost half of the Disneyland Hk this time and hurrah!!my kids missed a dumbo ride but I did it ho ho ho ho!!please see at least one of the Disneyland and you will cherish it all your life!!and say:ILOVED DISNEY!! "
1718,2016-8,"I love Disney! Hong Kong Disney does a wonderful job recreating the theme park from the states. It is smaller than the California park and wayyyyyy smaller than the Florida park but you still feel like your in the happiest place on earth. They have similar rides and fan favorites like Space mountain. If you use Klook, you can purchase tickets cheaper, we got ours for 60USD instead of 70. The best time to go is during the middle of the week, when there are less crowds. PS: You MUST see the Lion King show, it's fantastic!!"
1719,2016-8,"Not as large as Disney in LA, but a great Disneyland. As you would expect, perfectly clean and well maintained. We only purchased a day pass and felt that was enough, we were there from 10AM opening until 3PM, and left without feeling we had missed put on anything. The lines were an average wait time of 60Mins when we left, we could not face that long in the line! (but you expect lines at Disney, I wish it was not that way!). Good day out for the kids."
1720,2016-8,I don't know if i were to say this..there a lots of prc at hk disneyland..although they contribute most of the attraction economy in hk i feel it a need to educate them how to queue up and not just to rush on everything..btw the place is good..
1721,2016-8,"Even though I went here mainly to take my partner I fell in love with the Disney Spirit.This place was magical, staff and cast were great and loved every part of the Park. Great range of food, souvenirs and attractions. One con though was goft shop not open long enough after fireworks.Loved the Mickey Philbar Magic and the Jungle Book ride our boat driver host was awesome and really got into it.Thanks for a great day and now also being broke. Lol"
1722,2016-8,Was a great winters day in Hong Kong on xmas eve. We did not wait long for a ride and stayed until the end for the fireworks which was a bit of a letdown but other than that a great day was jad by all
1723,2016-8,"Took my daughter here for her 13th birthday. Got a 2 day pass and loved every minute of it.First day we read the bus thing wrong and only had 4 hours, wasn't enough. But we knew we had a 2 day pass so no matter. 2nd day we had 10 hours, too much. But as I said a 2 day pass was plenty, one day would of been huge.We enjoyed everything about it, the rides, the staff, the characters, the facilities, the food, the shopping, oh and more shopping. Our 2 favourites where Mystic Manor ride and the buzz shooting game. They where fun without scare factor, the buzz ride scared me though as the walkway moved and my mum fell after loosing her balance. They shut the ride down immediately to assist her to her feet and ensure she was ok. That was the scariest thing all day, but the staff where exceptional with her. (Mum 71)One back on her feet she shot everything that moved and had a great time.We loved the way the park was set out and the worlds still flowed. We loved the parade at 3pm it was fun and loud and awesome. From what I have been told this is one of the smallest disneylands but it's size didn't matter the fun factor was massive. Disney is Disney big or small it makes you smile. I have no other Disney to compare too but I loved everything about this Disney. I can imagine in peak season it would be packed so now January their winter is a great time to go. It was 22 degrees not packed and a pleasant day   days.Best theme park I ha e been to so far ever. Can't wait to see the USA ones if this is the small version. Perfect day out no matter what age 13, 45 & 71 we loved it."
1724,2016-8,"A day is never enough in Disneyland Parks. Children loved itFavorites were grizzly gulch. Space mountain. Rc racer. Mystic manor and philhar magic. A 4 star rating is given instead of 5 is because the prices of food inside is ridiculously high. 25hkd for a corn on the cob22hkd for a fish cake125hkd for ramen125hkd for 1 pc of mickeys head sushi ???Hello. Hello. I think needs looking into. Another point i would like to highlight are the mainlanders from china1. They are rude2. They try to cut lines and i have to use a little strong arm to put them in order3. One family brings their own lunch of duck and chicken and started eating them with just ordering 1 pcs of fish n chips to get a table. Pieces of bones were just thrown into the floor and in our horror, the grand pa remove his clothing and sat down bare chested. I could not accept this and report this to the restaurant keeper. They got a good scolding and then left the premises with a very2 dusgruntled faceI think disney should look into this matter seriously. The train to and fro was excellent. Fireworks great. Parade excellent. "
1725,2016-8,"One of the must go place in Hong Kong, specially when you travel with family. Need one full day trip if during the high seasons."
1726,2016-8,Disneyland is targeted towards youbg families...  Im a little jaded perhaps as its basically a large shopping mall....    Transport is efficient and the shows are very good.  Nightly fireworks are good..
1727,2016-8,It's a full time freak out place for all age groups Do little bit of study before you land so that you can enjoy more in less span of timeFASTPASS is recommended to save timeDo watch parade specially in evening and watch the fireworks Indian platter in TAHITIAN restaurant inAdventureland is goodRiver cruise in adventure land is very good
1728,2016-8,"We come during holiday season so very packed and long queue almost in every attractionWe quite have fun and ride almost all attractionTime square is very important especially when we need take picture with my son favourite disney character, when is parade time and last but not least fire worksThere are plenty shuttle bus to resort hotel where we stay (especially during peak before park open and a while after firework finish). This is a good pointFood very expensive and taste not very nice. Except the popcorn we like it so much Souvenir also very priceyService staff very friendly to the kids and professional in general (especially in safety aspects)"
1729,2016-8,"We had a good time at hk Disneyland, smaller than the original with fewer attractions,  but it's well maintained and not terribly crowded"
1730,2016-9,"Probably smallest of the parks.  Only a half day event so if you go, Lantau is a good option for the second half of your day.  Ocean Park was better!"
1731,2016-9,"Well maintained and definitely family friendly, its a great wonderland for children. There's a Frozen Christmas Tree light up by Ana & Elsa at 6.35pm if your kid is a fan of Frozen. The Paint the Night Parade at 7.35pm is also a colourful display of lighted carriages not to be missed! Unlike Disneyland Japan, the rides in this wonderland may not be exciting enough for adults looking for a thrill as this park is mainly built for children. We took abt a day & a half to explore the park and yet it is not enough to cover everything there. The queues are long and the rides only last a minute. Fast pass is only offered on two rides at Space Mountain & Winnie the Pooh Adventures. Our favourites are the U racer & the Mystic Manor ride. At night, the park becomes romantic with Main Street USA lit up. Do go to the park after breakfast as most of the restaurants in the park only open at 12pm except for the bakery where you can grab bread & coffee on the go unless you could find a seat at the outdoor parlour. "
1732,2016-9,"Disney place is dream for all children. Nice and beautiful place like we live in cartoon world. It is recommend to visit from 10 am until 9 pm due to many attractions. Consinder and manage ur visit to all attractions according hourly schedule based on disney brochure. You need to get fit enough if you visit during summer because too humid. Disney olace is huge theme park. December is best time to visit due cold season.The location can be reached by MTR Hong Kong from any line. If money not big issue, it is better stay in Disney Resort and you will get many prioritizes than normal visitor. Enjoy!"
1733,2016-9,"Disneyland is really the happiest place in the world! It is magical for both adults and kids! Our family had an absolute blast there! The rides are all fantastic and the attention to detail is really incredible. Everything was perfect! We would recommend getting a 3 day hopper pass for both parks as you definitely need a lot more than one day! Also, look into fast passes, they are free but they will save you a lot of time in ride lines! I RECOMMEND meeting the princesses! It is so much fun meeting them as they really are like the real ones!"
1734,2016-9,Been here meany times since the yellow submarine in Disneyland to the present great for all ages will always love Disneyland last visit was in 2015
1735,2016-9,If you are traveling with  children SERIOUSLY plan in a break in the afternoon. Nothing is more heart breaking then seeing these little ones having melt downs from too many hours at the park.
1736,2016-9,"If the Earth were to ever take an enema, the site would be here at this hideously overpriced, broken down artifact from the 1950s. Disneyland Park is the flagship of old Walt's evil plan to take over the world. And it seems to be working, since Disney, Inc. satellite  parks  have sprung up like poison mushrooms all around the globe, even in Paris. Disneyland shamelessly separates rube families from their hard earned cash with shockingly high admission fees, souvenirs made of crap, and junk food at sky high prices. Several of the aging main attractions were broken down when we visited. The implicit message from the parent corporation running this rank obscenity is that you pay through the nose, then get the hell out as soon as possible to make room for more suckers. You won't find a drinking fountain, a shady spot, or a place to sit down anywhere, so be prepared to get exhausted by being on your feet all day and for your kids to go bonkers overdosing on sugary drinks. You'll lucky indeed to avoid getting your toes flattened by one of the bloated legions of  Handicapped,  morbidly obese scooter riders you'll see everywhere who get to crowd to the front of the endless lines at the few rides that are working. And you won't be able to find a good drink anywhere either. But take solace that you can decompress when you leave what I call my version of hell on Earth with a well earned series of Martinis at Morton's about a mile away."
1737,2016-9,"The Mickey Town it is a surprise. It is an attraction tht you can't see in Magic Kingdom, Orlando. As the deep dive with Nemo. I have luck, the park stay open until 11:00 PM."
1738,2016-9,"While I have always loved Disneyland, it is just too expensive and crowded to be truly enjoyable, I'd rather take a 3 day cruise. It's about a hundred dollars for a day ticket. I can have a one year pass to knots berry farm for that price."
1739,2016-9,We have been bringing our kids to Disneyland every other year for the past 9 years from Canada and we love it. There is nothing that compares to the service and cleanliness of Disneyland. We have gone many different times during the year and find eArly March (before spring breaks begin) and September awesome time to go. This last time the world of colour was amazing as well as the parades. We truly had a great time. 
1740,2016-9,"This is the park that started it all. The only park that Walt Disney actually walked through. From Splash Mountain to Space Mountain, from Main Street USA to New Orleans Square, this park is a full day attraction that is the measuring stick by which all other theme parks are weighed. "
1741,2016-9,Loved loved loved Disneyland Park. Fulfilled a lifelong dream of going to Disneyland. It is everything i ever imagined it would be!
1742,2016-9,"We think 3 4 days is perfect for Disneyland.  Sadly, the second week in January you usually lose Haunted Mansion and Jungle Cruise as they get de holiday ed. We have made multiple trips and enjoy it more each time."
1743,2016-9,What does one say about DL?? It's simply another world and an escape into magic   it is being redeveloped at the moment so be aware of the closures and also choose your day to go when the crowds are less   get the phone app to see the waiting times and the fast passes   you can have a great stress  free time! Love it and would be back there in an instant!
1744,2016-9,"Truly the happiest place on Earth! Walt Disney sure knew what he was doing opening this place in 1955!! Every corner, every experience is pure Disney Magic. We take our kids every year and they love it more and more! Each kiddo has experienced Disney when they were infants. Our now 3 year old still talks about all her Disney trips! Our 6 year old is just as excited! (Of course so are we!) "
1745,2016-9,"No one can come close to doing an amusement park like Disney! Just walking into the park gets me all giddy and I'm 48! The smells, the atmosphere, the workers (or excuse me...they are called cast members, which is perfect because they really are putting on a show. A show of friendliness and pure joy), the characters, the rides. It's all just classic and fun. Yes, it's busy at pretty much any time of the year (there are some exceptions, but then at those times many rides are closing for maintenance). And yes, it is outrageously expensive and you just about have to take out a second mortgage to get your family there. BUT, if you can swing it, DO IT and go! You won't regret the memories youll have forever. "
1746,2016-9,"My husband and I spent NYE in Disneyland and it was so much fun. It was packed but there was tons of security, and everything moved along smoothly. Love going to disney when we are in CA."
1747,2016-9,Well what can i say its disneyland. Our tour was about to get cancelled as it as raining since morning but then by noon the sky cleared and we had a time of our lives.Highlight was the parade and the fireworks awesome.My daughter was over the moon and we spent one of the best days of our tour to USA.But the lines can get really long so plan your day.
1748,2016-9,It was my sons first time and trying to go again this year!! He love both parks and got to walk with Mickey and got it all on video definitely worth the money going!
1749,2016-9,"Disneyland!!! Need I say more???   Lines were short, food was great and the staff were sooo friendly and enthusiastic. DO NOT MISS the PAINT THE NIGHT PARADE and of course the fireworks. It really is the happiest place on earth"
1750,2016-10,"Disneyland is everything you envisioned and more. My young family absolutely adored Disneyland. Despite the crowd during the Xmas NYE period, we still love the whole experience."
1751,2016-10,"Disneyland Park is my favorite park in the world. The park has a lot to offer for Disney fans. I loved taking pictures with Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters. The Disney characters are very friendly and attentive. There are also a lot of very good attractions, ranging from walk ins, to dark rides. My favorite attractions in the park are Mickey's House and It's a Small World. The Disneyland Fireworks Show, live shows, and the parades were very stunning and inspirational, persuading many people (including myself) to make our dreams come true. Disneyland also has a lot of good restaurants with varieties of food, ranging from hamburgers to pasta. The tickets may be a little expensive, but are very worth your while if you love Disney! I strongly recommend this park to Disney fans and lovers of all kinds because the park's inspirational fireworks shows and friendly Disney characters will make you not want to leave the park."
1752,2016-10,"I had always wanted to go to Disneyland ever since i was a child watching the TV show on a Sunday night, so on our first trip to America with our children (10 & 14) i finally got there. It was good, but you need to do your homework.We only had 1 day so decided to do the original park. Maybe a mistake with the age of our children but still had fun (and they dont love scary rides).Thinks to do  1. Get their early (we drove from downtown (weho)and drive was okay (against most traffic)2. Use the fast past ticket line system (have a good read of how it works)3. Go in a clock wise direction (after getting fast pass for the busy rides)4. Try to go mid week, non holidays in winter5. Talk your kids out of waiting in line for the matterhorn (2 hour wait the day we were there with no fastpass)6. Remember were you parked your car (the carparks are huge)7. Have fun & takes lots of cash"
1753,2016-10,"I've been to Disneyland 5 times and will never get sick of it!!!! If you can't visit in the less busy times you will need lots of patience and stamina to make the day worthwhile! The park is only so big and when its busy, you're going to have to queue, so there's no use complaining about it as there's no way around it. If you only have a day or two, make sure you plan what you really want to do so you get the most out of it. While food can be a bit pricey, if you have a big breakfast you should be good until lunch, and when you're running around the park you tend to forget how hungry you are until you start noticing everyone walking around with the bread bowls. And take advantage of the Fastpasses! They are so useful, and will save you some time but only get them for the rides you really want to ride, as you can only have one at a time. The rides I always recommend are Big Thunder Railroad, Hyperspace Mountain, Haunted Mansion and Splash Mountain. I always recommend upgrading to the park hopper (unless you're there for more than 3 days) as I find I go between the parks 3 4 times in a day. I also love how enthusiastic and dedicated the cast members are, and one time a cast member called around the park for us looking for Sleeping Beauty   s schedule so we wouldn   t miss seeing her   they really do go above and beyond! There   s really nothing bad I can say about Disneyland, although if you aren   t a massive Disney fan like me, you will probably have a different (but still amazing) experience! Even if its raining on the day you will still have a blast and queues tend to be shorter, so if your family friends are willing to go in the rain, take advantage of it!! And finally: only ride It's A Small World if: a) your kids are begging b) you've never done it before or c) if its your all time favourite ride (for some reason)   my sister and I decided to go on it for fun our last trip and after 30 seconds we both regretted it because the song is waaaaay too catchy!"
1754,2016-10,"You really can't beat the original, especially in the off season. The park, as always, is fun. The diamond jubilee is just an extra treat."
1755,2016-10,"This really is the happiest place on earth. Not the cheapest, but the happiest. I am a self diagnosed Disney o phile. I love all things Disney and would have an annual pass if we lived in Southen California, alas we are 1000 miles away. If you haven't ever been, go! If you haven't been in awhile...GO! Be sure to bring lots of cash, because it is not inexpensive...it is, however worth every cent for the memories!"
1756,2016-10,"Disneyland has a mighty reputation and it is very commercialised but that was part of the appeal. This was my 3rd visit, with about 20 year gaps between each visit. We went on a very quiet day (January 19th) by Disneyland standards (but busy by my Kiwi ones). Love, love, loved it!!"
1757,2016-10,"We love Disneyland. We are Deluxe Annual Passholders and try to make it down a couple of times a year. We always enjoy ourselves. Disney customer service is beyond wonderful, and we never have any complaints in this department.My biggest complaint is how busy the park is nowadays. There is never really a value slow season anymore, now that so many people are passholders. When I was a teenager young adult, I could get through the park in two days, but now, with the wait times and the crowds, even with the Fast Passes, I can barely get the park covered in three days. It's a bummer. One thing is for sure...we NEVER go during Summer. It's too hot and too crowded and we do not enjoy ourselves.The park is always clean, customer service is excellent, and the shows and the rides are incredible. looking forward to Star Wars, but not the crowds. "
1758,2016-10,"As a Southern Californian, I have been visiting over 50 years. Have enjoyed as a child, teen, young adult and a parent. Waiting to share the magic with grand kids! A favorite with out of town guests. Always evolving and something new. Take time to enjoy the entertainment along with the attractions and rides.Prefer to plan our visits from 1pm to closing. Still feel the magic after half a century of annual visits. Evenings after 10pm is my favorite time. Crowds start to die down, kids head home, and twinkle lights give the park a special charm. Good time to hit your favorite rides and attractions."
1759,2016-10,Went there for a run Disney event and made a long weekend with the family. Loved the original rides that are no longer at Disney World or were never there.Food was good at the standard sit down restaurants as well as the shops and snack places being well stocked and full of nice cast members to help you.Ride times were a little long at times but with all the standard people as well as the runners that is to be expected.This was my second trip out to Disneyland and will either be my last or at east last for a long time until new attractions open
1760,2016-10,"This was my kids first experience. They had such a wonderful time. I would estimate the average wait time per ride at approximately 10 to 15 minutes which was much less than anticipated. Perfect timing, right before their refurbishment. We did nearly everything in one day. We went to California adventure of the second day and if we had to do it all over again, we would've just done Disneyland both days. Meals are pricey so people should plan for that. Definitely consider multiple days as the price does goes down."
1761,2016-10,"First visit to a Disneyland with my family. Our kids aged 4,6 & 10 loved it. Plenty of rides, for them to enjoy. We took a three day 2 park hopper pass. Fast pass was the way to go to get to the popular rides with a long wait time. Also the Disneyland app on smart phones (through app store) was useful to get real time time update on rides and to find attractions in the park."
1762,2016-10,"I love Disneyland! We have been many times over the years  during slow and peak season and we always enjoy ourselves. I find it helpful to have a rough plan for the day  knowing which ride and fastpasses to get at what time can be really helpful. And having food reservations is a great idea as well. If you don't like rides, walking several miles in a day, or standing in line, this might not be the place for you. But  if you love Disney and want a magical experience it is well worth the cost! And make sure to eat a churro!"
1763,2016-10,"We were really dissapointed in Disneyland, firstly we had to pay over $100 for a 3 year old. The main attraction we wanted to see was Cars, we managed a photo oppoortunity which we later couldn't locate to download from the given website. While the Car Movie itself it targeted to 3 10years the ride is fast and too scary for younger kids I was realy dispoonted the kids didn't have a slow version to ride. The Shifting tractors were also scary for a 3year old although borderline.There weren't many attractions AT ALL that I thought suitable for an under 6 and considering your are paying an adult fee fI'd give this a miss until your children were older"
1764,2016-10,"Like previous visits, had a wonderful time during our brief visit. The park was pretty full but the lines were manageable. Can't wait to return..."
1765,2016-10,"if you love riding classic rides you have to make the trip. i loved this park even more than magic kingdom... it has all of the most popular rides and a lot of the older, classics as well with hardly any wait time if you go during their off season."
1766,2016-10,Love visiting Disneyland.  Happened to go on a day that wasn't overly crowded.  It was great to see all the new improvements!
1767,2016-10,"I love Disney and I am a HUGE fan. I love Disneyland, and I always have an amazing time there   it's just so clean, safe, and well planned. You really do forget all about your worries and feel like a kid again. I put 4 5 instead of 5 5 purely because of how crowded it has gotten in recent years. We went in mid January and cast members were telling us we were there on a very slow day and it was 'insane how slow it was.' Let me tell you guys, it was NOT empty and the crowds were not light at all. There were tons of people there. If that was what a 'slow day' looks like nowadays... yikes! I'm a little nervous to plan another Disney trip though because if it gets any more crowded than that, I don't know how fun it will be."
1768,2016-10,"This was our first trip to Disney Land, we spent 6 days between the two parks.Lots of fun but it's different for a family who has been to Disney World dozens of times.We enjoyed our time here but given the opportunity to either do CA or FLA we'd have to recommend Florida. I will say the smaller footprint was much easier to walk. Space Mountain (hyperspace during our visit) was better than Space Mountain in Florida. Matterhorn was awful.That said, our annual pass gave us 20% merchandise here and we probably bought more than we would have otherwise because of that.WDW could take a page from DL on that one. Also the food options were better in DisneyLand than Magic Kingdom, overall anyway.We are in no hurry to return and as Disney fans it was very cool to visit but given the option, we'd choose WDW in FLA over the west coast."
1769,2016-10,"Who doesn't dream of going to Disneyland? From the moment you are walking towards the venue right to the minute you are walking out of the venue you are in child hood heaven. We loved every minute. You are screened on the way in, which is great from a security point of view. We were there in late January and it was beautiful weather, around 23 degrees in the day, and 15 at night. If you are there for the day, pack a change of clothes for your little one s as it can get chilly. We packed jackets and hats as well, to stay for the night parade. Queue times were not too bad, 45 minutes at most and some rides, we walked straight on. Our daughter is 5 and I think that's the perfect age as they can withstand the walking and there is so much magic in what you can see. There is alot to do and see. My biggest recommendation is not to worry about how you can carry everything back on the plane with you, instead see someone in the Disney store about getting what you want shipped to you. That's what I ended up doing. Some things are Disney exclusive and they won't ship it so ask, and that can help you decide what to buy now, and what to buy online. I loved the Disney merchandise and realised there just wasn't enough time to see it all. There are so many shops to conquer. Enjoy the magic of what Disney offers from a rides, entertainment and character point of view and leave the shopping for the comfort of your home. You will also thank yourself later, as you won't have to carry it all on the plane with you, or worry if it will get damaged."
1770,2016-11,Retunring after 14 years this place was still magical although the lines for rides were insane with some being at least a 2 hour wait. That would be the only BIG thing that needed to be fixed I would say
1771,2016-11,"The original and still great. The rides, the shows   the fireworks (the fireworks from Thunder Mountain Railway at night: just amazing. Indiana Jonnes, Star Tours, Space Mountain and more. Live as a child again. Let loose. It is fun."
1772,2016-11,"Bless his heart, Walt Disney is still alive and forever making people happy. I loved that this park has the   Older characters '  still in place. I was here 20 years ago and this was how I wanted it to be again. We went to the one in Florida the previous year and it doesn't compare to the history of Anaheim. The fireworks were superb and the parade was fun to watch. It was a slow day and colder so many of the rides had short to no lines. Its A Small World was and always will be my favorite ride. Simple and meaningful. Pirates of the Caribbean is a close second followed by the Haunted Mansion which was closed unfortunately. I couldn't help but tear up when the fireworks were flashing right behind the statue or Mr. Disney and Mickey Mouse. He truly gave us all a blessing and it still lives in Disneyland."
1773,2016-11,"I'm not a big fan of the whole Annual Pass. If I pay 100.00 plus a day for ticket, and have to stand in long line, listening to bunch of kids who got dropped off at Disneyland like every weekend. And have conversations with bunch of these people. And they also come all the time because they have annual pass. And everyone saving places in line. So lines are long in middle of January. And park stuff closed, and needs updated. And I know the star wars is coming but won't open for 2 years. If never been there, go, if been there last 15 years. Wait. It's same as last time you went. Except a lot more kids running around with no supervision."
1774,2016-11,"Disneyland is a magical place yes indeed. But I'm Australian from Sydney and travelled up the coast of Australia and visited all the theme parks on the Gold Coast. I have never come across people as I did in Anaheim and disneyland and adventure park. What took my breath away during our visits to Disneyland was the people working in he park. I have never met so many friendly, happy, people who greet you not only with a smile in their voice but even on those long days where the park is open late and you can see the exhaustion on their faces they never failed to keep up the positive attitude and respect. Oh my God the respect was phenomenal I have never come across a more amazing well trained and respectful team than at Disneyland. The greater Anaheim area itself has some in the most respectful people on this planet honestly. I can't get over how friendly everyone was. Thank you Disney for sleeting such an outstanding team. "
1775,2016-11,"There's so much hype about Disney, you feel like you need to modify your expectations because it could never be as good as everyone says. But it is.For three days our family woke up at 6am, walked 13 14 km, queued (but not as much as you'd think due to Fast Passes), rode, screamed, laughed, ate (sparingly as it really is overpriced), and generally had the time of our lives. It was like living in a magical bubble of fun where I could say yes to almost every request, where siblings didn't fight (told you it was magical) and we all simply lived in the moment, appreciating an experience which, for us who had come from so far away, we couldn't ever take for granted or waste a moment of. By making full use of the early magic hours, Fast Passes and lining up early for shows and parades, we made sure we weren't disappointed. Our kids (12,10, 8) were old enough to walk everywhere without complaint. It also meant we, mostly, were in agreement on what and when to do things. We appreciated the opportunity to child swap our 8 year old so she didn't have to go on a couple of rides that scared her. Night parades and fireworks are unmissable. Line up early for rides like Hyperspace Mountain and Indiana Jones. Use Fast Passes whenever you can. Use the App for wait times. We didn't have phone connection because we had international phones but if we saw someone using it, we'd just ask them. No one minded, everyone is happy. If you are staying in one of the Disneyland Resorts, take an hour or two to go back and rest in the middle of the day. You'll thank yourself at 10:30pm when your 8 year old is not hysterical. And finally, if you see a character and you want a photo with them, stop. They are harder to find than you think and lines to meet them can be long. Meeting the characters is super fun, and there are some, like Mickey Mouse (Toontown) and Chewbacca (Tomorrowland) that you can line up for, but many of the others simply appear. Near the entrance or on Main St are good places to check. And if you find one of your favourites and you fancy a photo, take the opportunity when it arises.Unlock your inner child, suspend disbelief and cynicism at the door and you'll have the adventure of a lifetime."
1776,2016-11,"As a kid in 1960s Australia, I was glued to the TV for the Sunday night Disneyland show, where I heard about Frontierland, Tomorrowland, Adventureland and  Fantasyland, the happiest kingdom of them all . It took me many years to see this wondrous place, and I have been back as often as I can afford. Every trip is another holiday away from the everyday, as you step into a bubble of time and space, where your cares are left behind, and the Disney magic envelopes you. Admittedly, so does a crowd of tens of thousands of others seeking the same magic! So you need to plan to make the most of your time (and money), and not get swamped by the hordes and spoil your magical day.Although I knew it was a risk, I chose to go in the week after New Year, so I could see the last of the holiday decorations and the holiday overlays on Haunted Mansion, Small World and the Jingle Cruise (no, that is not a typo!). And yes, it was certainly crowded! We got a 5 day park hopper ticket, which also took the pressure off feeling we had to spend every minute at the park, and we could pace ourselves. We pre booked some dining packages to ensure we had guaranteed seats for Fantasmic (wonderful show, now on hiatus), and World of Color in DCA. We had one Early Magic Morning, and made the most of that one hour, managing to ride on Star Tours, Hyperspace Mountain, Peter Pan (otherwise an insanely long queue for such a short but beautiful ride), Alice in Wonderland, and several others. Another hour of catching rides with shorter lines (use an app such as Touring Plans to check real time updates), and we were ready for a leisurely breakfast at the River Belle, another ride or two (old favourites such as Pirates of the Caribbean and Haunted Mansion) then back to our hotel for a long break. We returned early in the evening in time for the fabulous Paint the Night Parade, Fantasmic and the fireworks, all of which were spectacular. With the energy from taking a break, we could stay until close to park closing at midnight. When it poured with rain the next day, I was so glad we had done so many things on our first day! While the rain reduced the lines dramatically, it was far too wet for my comfort and we did not stay as long. It was worth it to see the Halloween   Holidays overlay at Haunted Mansion with Nightmare before Xmas   it suits the attraction so well. It was a nice change hearing Christmas Carols at It's a Small world, as was seeing the animated dolls in their holiday garb. And who would have thought it would work to theme the Jungle Cruise for Christmas?! More opportunities for those classic lame jokes. However the best of the holiday decor was the huge Christmas tree in Main Street, and the lighting for Small World (Christmas red and green lights instead of the gold and white). With Christmas themed food and treats, Christmassy smells, and everything lit up with millions of fairy lights, it really was a wonderland. As I use a mobility scooter, it is much more challenging in the crowded times as people walk right into you (while reading their mobile phones and not looking), kids tend to run in front of you, and it can be more stressful. One of the many things I love about Disney is that they make it as easy as possible to forget about the hassles, and enjoy yourself. The cast members at every ride were excellent, offering thoughtful suggestions for how to get into the various ride vehicles most easily; several allowed me to ride a second time straight away, as it had been difficult to enter the vehicle. Several of the restaurants let me ride up to my table and then the staff took the scooter for me and parked it, and brought it back at the end of the meal. For the parades, there are special roped off areas, policed by staff members, for those in wheelchairs and scooters, to ensure you can have a good view of the parades from a seated position. Don't let your disability deter you, Disney is the best in the world at making it as easy as possible so everyone equally can enjoy the magic. "
1777,2016-11,"We have season passes and go 4 5 times a year.  This year we have had great experiences.  The lines are long for the popular rides, but there are always lines at Disney.  The trick is to use the Disney app and watch the line times."
1778,2016-11,"We had a wonderful time. We were visiting over a weekend and the end of January. I would think that this would be a slow time however, the park was almost at max capacity on Saturday. The Festival of Fantasy Parade was worth the visit. There were several characters and princesses out greeting guest and lots of happy children!"
1779,2016-11,Love it so much more than Florida parks. Not as spread out because there is only 2 parks. So much fun to be had!
1780,2016-11,As always amazing. Clean and very well kept. You can't be disappointed in anything Disney. We are season pass holders who love sharing memories with our family.
1781,2016-11,"I have loved Disneyland since my first visit when I was 6 years old in 1963. It was fun as a child, it was fun as a teenager, and it was fun as an adult with children. Our children are grown now and I have twice made the trip to Disneyland with one of my adult sons. We love it. It is one of those places you never get tired of visiting. If you have never been, go. It can get very crowded, so research the best times to go."
1782,2016-11,"For Christmas, my family of four was given Disneyland tickets for a day (Thanks Grandpa and Nana!). My wife and I took a Monday off of work and pulled the kids out of school for a day to avoid the long lines on a weekend. Best time we have had at Disneyland. We still had to wait, but the lines were not too bad. We haven't been to Disneyland for about 6 years, so the kids were excited to go. Fun time had by all!"
1783,2016-11,If you are in the vicinity and have kids with you between 2 and 102  just go ... you won't be disappointed !!!
1784,2016-11,"Our family travels to Disneyworld in Florida 3 times a year for a week each trip. We love it and in WDW everything runs smoothly, even when lines do hit peak times. We were in LA this January for business reasons and went to Disneyland with my youngest (11) just because a. it is Disney, b. it is an amusement park and c. we were in the area. Well, let's say it is an under amusement park, the rides are almost the same as the ones we love in Florida but with crappy surroundings, cranky and poorly dressed (time to buy new uniforms!) cast members, no music, no festive atmosphere. It barely feels Disney, and it does not begin to feel  magical . As my daughter put it, she wanted to leave after 2 hours in the park (and the day we visited the lines were ok):  this is like what would look like if you were having a very bad dream about Magic Kingdom . I don't get how so many people still love Disneyland, I honestly feel bad about them since they are obviously deprived of fun choices or seeing the place clouded in their memories of the past or obviously we don't get it and they do. But for us to even begin to enjoy this place, they would have to make a major clean sweep in this park (trash sits everywhere), hire and train happy people, give them a nice, new looking uniform, put music and events in the park, fix the potholes, clean up their act with fast passes, buy new umbrellas and park fixtures, train the personnel at Town Hall, open new table service restaurants, add a Main Street  smell , and so on. No wonder the two parks are managed by totally separated companies   who ever Disney hires to maintain and manage this park should be let go, and bring in the big guns from Florida."
1785,2016-11,"We had two whole days in Disneyland Park and managed to get on all the rides that we wanted to. Take advantage of the Magic Hour as crowds are small and we managed to get on 4 of the rides that we wanted to. Not all rides are open during Magic Hour so do your research. I noticed people getting Fast Passes for rides so that they could get in line for the same ride later. There is also the opportunity for single riders to get on rides sooner. Just look for the signs. We were disappointed that a few rides were closed for refurbishment. My two favourite rides being the Haunted House and Jungle Cruise were closed however we took advantage of rides that we previously never got to.Here are some other hints for you.1. Get a Disney Gift card and top it up each day. Pay for food, drinks and gifts with it. Saves carrying cash around with you which you could lose on rides.2. Security will check your bags and there are metal detectors. Just be aware that there can be delays.3. When lining up at the main gates before opening time you will see one very long line to two turnstile. People see a line and join it without realising there are two turnstiles. We walked up to the second turnstile at that gate and ended up first in line. After receiving a few dirty looks we were quickly joined by more people.Food and drinks are expensive but you won't notice so much if you use your gift cards.4. Get a PhotoPass and link all the photos to it. Very convenient to use when you get home and you can view and pay for the photos when you get home.Get yourself the Magic Guide App for your iPad as it will provide you with waiting times."
1786,2016-11,"My wife and I took a day out from The NAMM Show and went to Disneyland Park, This was our 3rd trip there and we still agree it's the most wheelchair friendly park around. We were like young kids again, with rides like Peter Pan, Small World, King Arthur's Carousel, Pinochio and Dumbo.. all being very wheelchair friendly or an easy transfer. The only complaints we had for the day was... wait times for Star Wars characters, we didn't want to wait 30 mins or more to have a photo with Chewbacca... Buzz Lightyear we kept returning but the line got longer and longer.... Disney Rail is closed for a year... so expect a bit more walking rolling around the park. Star Tours although a tight squeeze through the doors in my chair, was an easy transfer from my chair into a seat... and very worth it."
1787,2016-11,"I love visiting Disney parks, this was my first time visiting California so Disney was a must!My girlfriend and I drove to the park. I thought at the price of the tickets that car parking should've been free but then again Disney to a lot of people is a massive tourist trap.During bag search the security took my girlfriends selfie stick yet we did see people using them!If you only have 1 day to visit a park I would recommend the California Adventure park instead.Waited well over an hour for Hyperspace mountain as it had broken down. Pirates of the Caribbean was really disappointing compared to the Orlando ride. It broke down whilst we were on it.Quite a small park. We arrived around 3pm and stayed until after the fireworks but you could easily arrive first thing in the morning and go home around 1   2 pm and do something else."
1788,2016-11,"Even though we went in the off season, when many things are undergoing refurbishing we had a great time. The weather was great and as always Disneyland does not disappoint. We got a park hopper pass for one day so we could go to three attractions at California Disney as well. The new light parade is really beautiful and the fireworks are even more amazing than when we went 3 years ago. All in all we had a great Disney experience. We only had to wait in line at the Radiator Springs car ride, so not bad. So plan on coming early and staying late to enjoy as much as possible."
1789,2016-11,"Okay,So we live in Hong Kong, we go to Disney there a lot and to be honest it isn't a great experience. Usually we have to fight hordes of Mainland Chinese travellers with not always great manners and customs that are reviled in the West.So Disney in California was a fabulous experience for us, it's big, the cues are relatively short, the visitors don't let their children poo and wee on the ground, people don't spit, cut their nails, pick their noses or do their washing (yes... and I've seen it) and adults don't fight toddlers for baby rides.So this place to us was heaven,We have three daughters, twins aged 5 and a 6 year old, they loved beyond belief the Peter Pan ride, dumbo ride, magic Tea Cup, Pinocchio scared them... me too! The merry go round, Pooh Bear, Alice in Wonderland, the princess castle   Toads crazy driving ride, the girls met Cinderella, Rapunzel (who was gorgeous   the girls adored her) Snow White Belle (another gorgeous actress   who like Rapunzel was really in the role) and Aurora.We also rode its a small world and several other rides.All in all, it was a fabulous 4 days, we loved most of the visit (it's never easy with children) Only down side was that some one stole the pram that we rented   this really made us angry as one of our daughters were sick, she had a virus in her muscles and could not walk well and then pram man would not issue us another one to replace it.Other wise it was a fabulous trip"
1790,2016-12,"Despite all the closures for all the new and exciting changes Disneyland Disneyland is such a great place to visit. We are season pass holders living about 5 hours away and try to make it every two months or so. Our last visit was for 4 park days, even though the crowds were more then expected we had a wonderful time. Can't wait for our next visit."
1791,2016-12,"For me the visit was a must as I had always wanted to visit the original park and it does not disappoint. It is spotlessly clean and the theming is just stunning. Although aimed towards younger Children there is something to suit all ages. The Matterhorn ride though resulted in 2 of us bruising our backs quite badly. The ride is so bumpy it is uncomfortable (never again) I arrived at the park early and was questions by security concerning my Camera, I own a GJI Osmo gimbal Camera and they thought is was a selfie stick. For some reason selfie sticks are not permitted in the park.. Odd ! To be honest if security at the gate were satisfied with the Camera that should have been sufficient, I was stopped in the park at least 9 times and questioned on one occasion just as a ride was leaving the boarding area it was stopped and I was again questioned. Not impressed. . That aside everything runs extremely well and the organisation is very apparent. By lunchtime the park was extremely busy with average wait times on the bigger rides of 60 mins. We waited 95mins for Space Mountain, only upon leaving were we told about the option to pre book times for major attractions. Disneyland is a must see and is a beautiful setting for some wonderful Photos, a one day ticket cost us $99 add on the hugely inflated food and beverage prices it can be expensive but swallow the price and enjoy it. For me the parade was worth the admission alone. The characters (staff) in the parade are so professional and the whole thing is just stunning no where in the world can come close to the way the US present a theme park it is just stunning. For me this Disney park had far more character than the Florida park which seems vast in comparison. This park feels so much better and has a wonderful atmosphere. Considering its the 60th Anniversary the place is immaculate. Well done Disney"
1792,2016-12,"Disneyland is classic fun, for the whole family. We live in Arizona, but love it so much that we purchased annual passes this year so that we could go as much as possible!The character meet and greets allow you meet most all of your favorites, and the rides are so much fun...from the classics like Dumbo and It's a Small World, to the new Hyperspace Mountain, there's something for everyone! And with all the food they have to eat...it's lucky that you have plenty of room to walk off all those calories! From open to close Disneyland is always fun, fun, fun!"
1793,2016-12,"My husband and I have been loyal pass holders for years. January was the end of that tradition due to another raise in prices. We just don't think the value for the price is the same lately because of so many rides attractions being down for the updates to the park in combination with the amount of guests causing it to feel especially crowded. However normally Disneyland is the happiest place on earth and there is plenty to do for all ages. I especially love the train and the shows. I am always excited to meet the characters, too. I think they do a wonderful job of bringing the roles to life in the park and they are fun to interact with. The new fireworks show is outstanding. However it can be cancelled last minute due to wind or weather so don't count on seeing it if you only have a one day ticket. "
1794,2016-12,"This was our second trip to Disneyland. My girls were 7 and 11 on this trip. Three days was not enough so next time we'll go for 4 or 5! Every trip we learn something new and valuable!I highly recommend the character breakfast at Plaza Inn, especially if you have little ones! Minnie and friends come around to the tables and it's a delicious buffet breakfast with a lot of options.There are so many things to do! We watched s Frozen play at the Royal Hall and also Mickey and the Magical Map.I also recommend getting the Disneyland app so you can check wait times and FastPass availability. It's great as it also shows where characters are!This is our all time favorite place to go! Can't wait to go again!"
1795,2016-12,"Seasons of the Force was the reason we went to Disneyland this time and we weren't disappointed. It was awesome! My family had a great time, we will definitely be back soon."
1796,2016-12,Disney is billed as the happiest place on earth and it certainly feels like it. This place is amazing for all ages its just fantastic. Walt knew what he was doing. The characters roam the park & orderly queues ensure plenty of photo ops. Queues for rides can be long but its the same in any theme park. Food & drink prices what you expect but not too bad clothing etc ok too.My advice go & enjoy its marvellous
1797,2016-12,"Disneyland has hit critical mass   there aren't any slow times anymore. The last week in January was very busy with long line ups, and this was Tuesday through Thursday. If you go during a time when children are in school then expect an ocean of strollers (with very young babies), pre schoolers, and on the other side of the demographic spectrum, volumes of adults and seniors. The three teenage boys in my group managed to have a blast regardless   they found ways to circumnavigate the crowd and enjoyed Big Thunder and Splash Mountain at park opening times as the masses of people typically head towards FantasyLand and TomorrowLand. Peter Pan Flight line ups were 45 minutes within the park's opening. The whole park is going Stars Wars   it was disappointing that the delightful DL train was down as was some of the waterfront area including the Tom Sawyer Island Pirate's Lair and Fantasmic. Small World was also being refurbished, as was Autopia and the iconic Jungle Cruise. In California Land, at least two of the big draws were shut down: World of Color and Soaring Over California. In addition, the Aladdin show had already ended its run. During our visit, several of the key rides seemed to suffer technical difficulties and hence were shut down for portions of the day. The night parade is gorgeous   but hard to see if one doesn't save a seat for three hours on the pavement. We tried to watch it from the Plaza Inn where we had dinner   but the view was limited. All in all one must determine if the price of admission is worth it   DL tickets go up every year   there are so many locals attending that there isn't a downtime anymore. The overall design and visuals are stunning   the gift stores and restaurants are overpriced but part of the experience. Staff tries very hard to please. If DL is a vacation destination then do your homework, budget accordingly, and be prepared to wait in long line ups; but if you plan wisely, you and your group will have a magical experience. If you are lucky, like my group was, a very nice family may even offer you their unused fast passes."
1798,2016-12,Loved Disneyland! Immaculate grounds and great rides. Over 20 years since we've been there so was a wonderful surprise.
1799,2016-12,"Be prepared for lots of walking and lots of fun.  Things to see around every corner.  Helpful staff is everywhere, all you have to do is pick a direction and go explore.  Walt really had it going on."
1800,2016-12,"We go here often, usually hopper passes, however Im very happy to stay on the disney side. take in the whole scene, don't just try to get in as many rides as possible. watch the parades, and fantasmic . if you have young children that cant ride, make sure that you get the child pass off pass for the person watching the children when you enter because after the ride you can give it to the person that could ride because they were watching children and they can take 2 others with them via an dgo pretty much straight to the ride avoiding the long lines. If you want to ride as much as possible then get in the singles line and you are riding fast within a few minutes, especially at the Matterhorn."
1801,2016-12,"We first tried to get into Disney land in the afternoon. We had quite a wait at the ticket office, then had to queue up again at the gate. We got through the gate only to be randomly selected for a further search. All in all, it took us about 1 hour to actually get into the park, even though we had bought our tickets online. The actual parks aren   t as big as I had expected, and more of the bigger rides are in Disney California Adventure. The parade and the firework show are well worth seeing, but the light show on the evening wasn   t as good, and could probably be missed out if you are tight on time. Make sure that you get the queue jump tickets for popular rides, such as cars, which is really fun. If you wear glasses, no need to take them off for any ride."
1802,2016-12,We went here filled with excitement and had high expectations to be overwhelmed with joy after being told it is the  happiest place on earth . The park was absolutely packed when we arrived and we had to wait almost an hour to get parked and in the front gate. There hardly any thrilling rides or anything which was worth the 1 hour plus wait times so we spent the majority of the day walking around battling the insane crowd. All of the staff had fairly monotonous personalities and there wasn't a whole lot to see and do so we left after a few hours only. Universal Studios was so much better and a lot cheaper. Disneyland would probably only be good for little children.
1803,2016-12,"Kept to the Disney plan that always delivers, great rides especially Indianna Jones, magic mountain with the parade and firweworks a must."
1804,2016-12,"Family had a great time the last week of Jan. the stand by lines were manageable this time of year, average wait about 25 minutes or less on the more popular rides like the Matterhorn, star tours, splash mountain, big Thunder mountain railroad and the haunted mansion. The weather was still nice too about 69 74 during the day time. Will probably go back next year around the same time of the month. "
1805,2016-12,"We just did three days at Disneyland and had a really good time. We had 8 people in our group ages 4 years to 80 years old. There was something for each of us to enjoy at Disney! We did research our trip   we knew what rides would be closed if we went in Jan. We also had a loose plan to follow to ensure we didn't flounder at the park but got to see and experience with rides we each wanted to do. We also took my 80 year old wheel chair bound mother in law: so we planned ahead for her needs. My advice is do some planning and research before you go so you get the most of your experience. We brought our own wheel chair in the park but they do rent them for $5.00 day first come   first serve.On traveling with a person in a wheel chair   scooter check with the Cast Member at the ride you want to do. The Cast Member will tell you when you need to return for that ride or anything else you need. They will not physically transfer people so the people in your party need to be able to do this. There isn't a ride there my mother in law could not do if she wanted too   she rode the Matterhorn and LOVED it! There is a handicap area for the parade by the Tinker Bell area BUT....many parents feel this is a place for the their healthy children in strollers   the area is clearly marked handicapped. Its a very small area and if the fireworks and parade are on your  must sees  then find a better location about 6 pm. Tips as well   lots of restaurants will sell you  reserve seating  for the parade   fireworks with your meal   they sell how ever many they can get people to buy and buying one doesn't gaurentee a seat will be available for you   this area is small (maybe fits 20)  our suggestion don't buy it and find a better spot for FREE!! We didn't buy one but we were present when a family went to collect their purchased seats and there were no seats...this got very ugly very fast. In the end the family had to find other seats.Food is decent   you can find fresh fruit and healthier snacks. You can also bing food in   we did and never had a problem doing so. You can find a salad or two if you want. The Bengal BBQ has awesome meat on a stick   small but tasty! Tikki Hut Dole whips are yummy! Snack areas everywhere and open all night. If you want sit down meals   make a reservation. We had reservation at Tortilla Jo's in Downtown Disney at 5:30 pm, checked in at 5:20 pm and were seated immediately. Realize that Toon Town has snacks, hot dogs, no real food and if raining the food area will be closed. Weather in CA in Jan   Feb can be sunny, slightly breezy, windy, rainy, or all of the above in the same day! Lays are your best bet and so are warmer jackets. Bring ponchos unless you want to pay $12 each at the park. For us its rained on Sunday off and on but I would take that over any other day there. The longest we waited in line was 15 min and that was so my mother in law could meet Thor."
1806,2016-12,"It was our family's first trip and it was everything that I had heard read thought it was! We had a blast and I'm so glad we went in January when it was lower crowds.The reason for the 4 out of 5 rating is because of the wait time for rides (our longest was 40 minutes) and the need for more bathroom signage. Also, there are so many strategies and ways to see the park and so much going on that sometimes things were a bit overwhelming and confusing. But it was a great time! And the fireworks show absolutely blew us away!!Until next time, Disneyland!"
1807,2016-12,It was perfect!!!  We had the most magical time!!!  All of their cast was incredible.  I just can not say enough great things about Disney.  We took our family of 9 and had a blast.
1808,2016-12,My daughter and I were only there for one day but were able to visit everything that we wanted to visit using the Fast Pass system and because it was in late January.  It wasn't as crowded as summertime but still just as much fun!
1809,2016-12,"This was our second visit to the park. We had a pretty good idea what we wanted to cover on this trip. We were blown away by the Firework show!! I've not seen anything like it in my life as they celebrated the Parks 60th anniversary in style! Splash Mountain and Big Thunder Railway were my two favourite rides in the park. Loved seeing all the characters and happy that we managed to get a few pictures with them, without waiting in major line ups. Star Tours and Hyper Space Mountain were a lot of fun but an insane amount of people, compared to other areas of the park. It was nice to do the rides and find less crowded areas to enjoy. We used the monorail daily, it saved us a lot of time from walking to from the park. My biggest tip is to use the Fast Pass as much as possible, saves a lot of time other then wait in line for ride. Another tip is that we always brought our water bottles and a few snacks into the park. We did find a restaurant across from Splash Mountain for lunch one day, it was decent food for a decent price and quiet restaurant. I had the Picnic salad with strawberry vinaigrette dressing for $10 and ate every bite, it was delicious! We were there during the week in January, so the crowds were pretty manageable. I talked to one lady at the park and she said September is their quietest time. We will come back when the new Star Wars section is complete."
1810,2016-12,"One of the more fantastic entertainment places in the whole world. Get there early and run to get the fast pass for the hyper space mountain ASAP and then get in the line for another. If u arI always think that making an hotel review is something very subjective and kind of personal, because we all are different persons, we always came from different places, have different costumes, habits or ways to see things. So, i rather prefer to make a   simple list of things which i like or dislike. Hope it work for u move quick and u are lucky u can ensure 2 of the most popular rides in less than 30 min, which could get u 2 or 3 hours in the rest of the day. "
1811,2017-1,"Our family has been going to Disneyland almost every year since 2005! It truly is the happiest place on earth! This year is the 60th Diamond Anniversary Celebration, so make sure you catch Disney's Paint the Night Parade and the Fireworks show right after! It is truly amazing! Make sure you're somewhere on Main Street or by the Castle to get the best view!"
1812,2017-1,"We went on New Years Day, the California Adventure Park was not crowded at all. We were able to get into all the rides we wanted without much of a wait. We then went into Disneyland and found a slightly larger crowd but nothing like what you would think you would find on any given weekend or holiday. Again we were able to get on all the rides that we wanted that night and we were able to get good spots for all the parades. Unfortunately the fireworks could not be seen because of winds. We had a wonderful time with our granddaughter before taking her back home to her parents."
1813,2017-1,"It got 3 stars from me because it was Disneyland. I have visited the park now 6 times in my life. All were fabulous, but I have to say this one was far below the Disney experiences of the past. Worst part is it was my son's first experience that he will remember. The park was dirty. Garbage all over the place including just walking in for the magic morning. How can it be dirty already? Was like this every day. The other non Disney like experience were the cast members. Disgruntled. Not friendly. Of course the  Disney  people that work there were overly smiley and such, but the rest were not fun. The worst was my wife and I broke down for corn dogs and we found a table across from the First Aid area. We sat there for an hour and I said we aren't moving until one Disney cast member smiles. Well after an hour I had to get moving, but not one time did someone smile. This was an exit area for cast members, so it was a steady stream of people. All disgruntled, with very negative and inappropriate conversations. I am no prude and can often be associated with longshoremen or sailors, but this is Disneyland! What the heck? "
1814,2017-1,"Spent the weekend going between Disneyland and CA Adventure.  Always love going to these parks.  Of course, all the rides had super long lines but they had the Fast Passes that helped."
1815,2017-1,"We purchased a 1 day park hopper pass at $155.00 EACH. We entered Disney park and waited in line for our first ride for 40 min only to have the ride break down. Then to space mountain, the sign said 50 minute wait time. We waited 55 minutes to only find out we are only halfway to entering the ride building. We waited almost 2 hours for that one ride. A few rides were closed and for what they charge to get in the place I can't understand why they can't fix these rides. Off to California park, not as crowded as disney that was a plus but wait time were just as long.The cost of the park is not online with the experience you will have. A family of 4 will have spent a thousand dollars consevitivly and only get on a few rides and probably not the ones they want."
1816,2017-1,Awesome amazing experience i myself have been here about 15 times in 20 years but my best friend had never been and my wife had only been once and we are 20! so much fun just make sure to get fastpasses
1817,2017-1,"I was here around the same time last year.This time is was much better, more rides were open.The Disney maps weren't much good to us, as the easy way around the park was closed due to them making the new star wars rides.So we had to walk what seemed to be a long way to get from A to B, with out bumping in to every one, it was so busy.The signs aren't much good, finding the rides. I think they want you to go around in circles, hoping you stop and buy something, less time on the rides.We went on 4 top rides in 4 hours that was good going for us.If you are a couple go to splash mountains exit, you will by pass the massive long queues, if you don't mind going single, meaning you just wait for a party of 3 or four to get on, and you join them at the back to fill up the boat, your partner gets the next available seat. Brilliant, saved us almost two hours."
1818,2017-1,"We visited Disneyland in January with our eight year old son. My summary of the experience is:  ticket prices are prohibitively expensive, particularly if you have more than one child  the park itself if VERY, VERY crowded. We deliberately chose a  quiet day on a quiet week  and it was still ridiculously crowded. Wait times on rides ranged up to 70 minutes which is just crazy. Clearly the number of annual pass holders clog up the park making it way too busy  the rides themselves are old, old, old and need to be updated  food at the park is poor quality and expensive  if you choose to go, learn the fast pass system before you enter the park as this is somewhat helpfulWe would not recommend a visit to Disneyland."
1819,2017-1,"My wife and I have been to Disneyland about 20 times in our lifetime, dating back to the mid 60's. There have been a lot of changes but it remains a place like no other. I do wish Disney would limit the number of people in the park, as crowding does erode the experience. Not only are the lines longer, it becomes difficult to maneuver in many locations. I do like the opportunity to have photos taken by employees and seen online. The characters are great, especially the new Star Wars additions. "
1820,2017-1,"If you love Disney, and we do, you will love this park. We went in mid January for the Star Wars Run. Park was much more crowded than we have ever seen it which was a surprise for us. But we did all we wanted to even if it took longer than we imagined. The parade and fireworks were great. Sad that the railroad is closed due to renovation and Haunted Mansion was closed because it was being redecorated, but some attraction is always closed so that is to be expected.If you love Disney, this place is always fun and full of good times and great memories.But please do not be like some people in our party! The new secutity measures require some additional screenings for randomly selected people. If you get selected (and I did 3 times and I am a little old lady), but do it   don't give those people a hard time. They are there to protect you and keep Disneyland secure and safe and fun!!!"
1821,2017-1,"We had such an amazing time In Disneyland. It really is the happiest place on earth. All the staff are helpful and the characters are great. We ended up going on a few quiet days and a few very busy days. I did enjoy the park more when it wasn't so packed but we still enjoyed every moment. I highly suggest utilizing the fast pass system for the larger , popular rides. With kids, standing in a line for 2 hours is not an option. These passes able you to come back at a pre set time. Made it so much easier. We ended up doing most of our rides in the morning and afternoon and took in the parades in the evening. The parades and fireworks were so beautiful. I loved the paint the night parade. Such a grand show. We had park hopper passes but didn't leave Disneyland the first 2 days. We will definitely be back!!"
1822,2017-1,"How many days should we visit to get a good Disneyland experience? Our kids are 13, 8, and 6! We were planning on going march 6th through the 8th. Is it enough or too much with young kids?"
1823,2017-1,"Okay, first the caveat that I absolutely love anything Disney so I would be hard pressed to give anything less than  5.  Disneyland takes you to other worlds, fun and adventure. That being said, while we went mid week and off season, the crowds were still discouraging. Believe me, it is no fun waiting 20 to 30 minutes for almost every ride  particularly when we tried to schedule our visit with supposedly lower crowds. It is hard getting through those crowds  and keeping in good spirits. (And why do people navigate with strollers like they do as madmen on the freeway?!?) I had to dodge rude stroller moms and dads several times. The evening light parade was gorgeous and the 60th Disneyland Celebration fireworks were the best fireworks I have ever seen anywhere! "
1824,2017-1,"I've been to Disneyland so many times. My biggest complaint is the crowds. Too many people are let in. We went on a day that was supposed to be at half capacity and waited between 30 45 minutes for just about everything. I avoid the park in the summer. Paying $100 to stand all day isn't appealing. The fast pass system is a marginal help. You can only get one at a time and only for the ride you are standing in front of. This means you would have to go to a ride, get the pass and then circle back. But you are also wanting to do other things. Your whole day becomes trying to manage your fast pass and less about enjoying the park. The problem to me seems to be the season pass holders. The people that show up to do a few rides and don't have anything else to do. My thought is that Disney should offer the ability to map out an entire day   essentially fast pass the park. If they allowed people to do that up to a week before their visit, it would allow those who are actually on a vacation schedule to really enjoy the entire park. Pick the rides and attractions you want to see and a computer generated schedule is returned to you. Stick to the schedule or suffer the consequences. The Fast Pass can still be used by last minute guests. The Fast Pass is free (yay!), however, I would pay a reasonable price ($25 30 ticket) for a scheduling service. Maybe more if it meant I was able to enjoy everything in the park. Also, Disneyland needs to do something about the line jumping. One person will stand in line while the other 4 5 in the group is off doing something else. Then they want to join the line. I always say no and tell them to get behind me. If the people behind me are ok with it, oh well. Food is too expensive and is pretty bad. The security inspections as you enter are a joke and really exist to give people a false sense of security. One person in my group was wearing a travelers vest with twenty six pockets full of stuff. No one checked the interior and he walked right by the metal detector. I had a travel pouch with multiple compartments and only unzipped one. Don't get me wrong, i don't want to be slowed down by 15 minute searches. I want them to go away. I don't mind walking thru a metal detector. But be sure everyone goes thru it. If you shlep huge strollers or backpacks, by all means go thru a 15 minute search. But don't just pay lip service. It is insulting. "
1825,2017-1,"We had a great day and enjoyed our Disney experience. The staff was nice and meeting the characters was fun! I would say the price for a 3 year old was NOT worth it, though. We rode rides that were equivalent to Silver Dollar City which is maybe half the price. I have to say Silver Dollar City totally kicks it in play areas for the smaller children. The Mickey toons section was cool looking, but not very interactive. Older kids would be worth it, but paying $93 for a 3 year old is bit ridiculous. My major complaint: We intentionally went on a day that would hopefully be less busy. (Although it was PLENTY busy.) We paid full price for us and our toddler (only a $7 discount   really??). Anyway, my point is we paid full price for a shorter day. (Closed at 8). And at 5 pm we went to a restaurant back in critter country that I had scoped out ahead of time for our gluten free needs. They were closed!!! They closed other places early too. This completely frustrated me! I can understand them closing maybe an hour early, but 3 hours? And over the dinner hour. Multiple rides were also closed for construction. All that added up to disappointment. We did have a good day, but I expected more. "
1826,2017-1,"Visited in 2009. My favorite place in the world     magical!! I recommend it to everyone willing to have heaps of fun :) Long lines  on weekends and school holidays, so I recommend visiting Disneyland on a weekday if possible."
1827,2017-1,"Went with my family of 5, they had plenty of rides for my little ones (ages are 4, 2, and 1) all of my kids had a blast and when it was time to rest for a bit there was plenty of benches and covered areas. The family had a BLAST! Will be doing this again soon!"
1828,2017-1,"I sincerely hope Disney will get the Annual Pass problem under control. We always plan our annual Disney trips during what was once considered non peak or off season times of the year....mostly to avoid the huge crowds. The annual passes, particularly for SoCal residents have virtually eliminated any kind of off season. On this last visit our full price 4 Day Park Hoppers cost our family over $1600. What we got for $1600 were insane crowd levels (on a Monday, Tuesday & Wednesday); reduced park hours (10am 8pm) and many closed attractions. We knew about the closures for Star Wars Land but many other things were also closed (Soaring Over California, etc.). With the crowd levels at approximately 86% or more each day it made it difficult to stand in long lines, particularly with a 3 year old. You'd think in the middle of the week in late January you'd be able to ride everything, at least one time in 4 days. Didn't happen on this trip. Since the annual passes had no blocked days and the hotels were not full (our hotel manager predicted a  slow week ; ha what a joke!) one can only assume the SoCal residents took advantage of the nice, sunny weather and flooded the park. If this situation does not change my family will re think our vacation and start going somewhere else. It's gotten completely out of hand and makes it miserable for travelers who are forking out big bucks coming from out of the area. Please Disney!!! Fix this problem!!"
1829,2017-2,Each time we come it gets better and better. Love all the Star Wars additions. Meeting Chewy was a huge treat!  There are some closures right now but it doesn't detract from the fun.
1830,2017-2,"Disneyland is an American institution. Everyone absolutely has to visit at least once. If you are visiting the area for just a short amount of time, you can see the highlights in one day. I would suggest that if it fits in your schedule, do two days at Disney. You can spread out your activities and take it easy by visiting your hotel's pool or a nearby restaurant in Downtown Disney. Disneyland actually consists of two parks, Disneyland Park and Disney's California Adventure. When you buy a ticket, you can pay a base price for one park or can upgrade for the ability to go to both parks on the same day. If you only want to pay for one park and only have one day, Disneyland is the park to do 1000%.Yes, it's crazy, absurdly expensive. If you are going to Disneyland. You need to be prepared to spend money and to be in large crowds. The sooner you accept that, the more fun you will have. If you constantly complain about those two things, it will be miserable for you.My family loves Disneyland and we have people of all ages. "
1831,2017-2,"Disneyland has always been one of my favorite all time go to places. My father took my sister and I the first year it opened. My husband and I had our first date there...so it only goes to say that we try and go back every year at least once   sometimes I've been lucky enough to go more than once even thought I don't live in CA. I was sooooo disappointed a few weeks ago. The last time we went to Disneyland we bought one of their puzzles. I love everything Disney and we love their puzzles. We have almost all of the Kinkade puzzles. The puzzle I bought last fall was the Kinkade Beauty and the Beast. I took it home and my husband and I proceeded to put the puzzle together. Low and behold it was missing one piece. This is the first time I have encountered this with any of their puzzles. Well we went back a few weeks ago and took the puzzle with us, receipt and all. We stopped in the shop where we had purchased it the first time. I told the salesclerk what happened and she said she had to call for her mgr. The mgr came and I explained to her what the problem was. She told me because it was over 30 days old, she couldn't do anything for me. You can't imagine how disappointed I was when she told me. In this day and age you need to put the puzzle back together and take it back to the park before your 30 days are up, even if you don't live in CA. After all of the thousands of dollars, yes, that we have spent there one puzzle was not worth making it right. I will think long and hard when I purchase anything from them again. It still makes me feel sad."
1832,2017-2,Easy to get to and always a wonderful time. They provide happy times for all. Really expensive but one must look at all the overhead costs associated with running this place. I will always be a fan even though I live in Orange County and buy a pass yearly I never get sick of it.
1833,2017-2,"For as many times as we have visited Disney World parks in Florida, this was our first time as a family at Disneyland. While the park was much smaller, we loved that it offered some different rides and attractions. It was also great to be able to meet Anna and Elsa without a 4 hour wait! They did have Dole Whip (a huge plus in my book), but the Cast Members at this park were nowhere near as friendly as WDW. We were very surprised that no one was really smiling or telling us to have a magical day. Also, the flashlight wavers who were moving Main Street sidewalk traffic during the parade were exceptionally rude   I understand they have to keep people moving, but if there are 10 people in front of me, urging me to  keep it moving  is not going to help me get anywhere faster. "
1834,2017-2,"They say disneyland is the happiest place on earth, well they are correct. It makes you happy to be there. the rides are fantastic I enjoyed a lot of them with my son. Although I really suggest to book your fast track ahead of time. I didnt know about fasttrack before my trip. I definitely will go there again."
1835,2017-2,They have some interesting things to see and do. Do your research and make sure your child is willing to stay in line and is keen enough to want to spend a good part of the day in sun and agitation. I saw a lot of whiny kids including my own and frustrated parents. 
1836,2017-2,"impeccable park, lines were quite reasonable Jan weekdays (we went on a Monday and Wednesday)  never waited more than 20 minutes   often no wait, to get on rides"
1837,2017-2,"We went to Disneyland for my daughter and her friends 15th birthday. My 17 year old daughter also went along as no one could remember the trip we took when they were little. I made the mistake of going on the Star Wars Marathon weekend, so it was really busy. It was everything you have heard   long lines, expensive food, tons of people. But it was also very clean, the people that work there are generally nice and the churro are amazing. The only disappointing part was the fast pass system, which was a joke in my opinion. Overall, I am glad we went, but I am glad that I won't have to go back for a long while."
1838,2017-2,"It's great for kidsand adults, be prepare to walk all day long, everything is expensive inside the park, specially food, there is so many variety of food."
1839,2017-2,"I have always wanted to visit disneyland and was so glad that we did as it was everything I exspected plus more. We went in January after the kids went back to school so there was less people there. We have a 4 day pass which we spread out by having a few days in the middle doing something else, such as a few day trips. The longest that we waited for a ride was 90mins. There is something for everyone. I can't wait to visit again. We found that food was a little expensive so left the park at tea time and ate at one of the nearby restaurants."
1840,2017-2,I have been to Disneyworld a few times   but this was my first visit to California & Disneyland. It was AMAZING! So many things to see & do on such a small footprint! I will be back :)
1841,2017-2,"2nd week in January, good time to go. Busy but not terrible. Longer lines even with Fast Passes. Lots of fun for all  ages. Love the parades, day & night.  Great fireworks"
1842,2017-2,"I would reiterate the following advice that you see on various sites; go during the week if you can, take advantage of the magic mornings to go on as many rides as possible before it gets busy, and make strategic use of the Fast Pass services offered for some of the rides (have a  runner  who gets fast passes while others go on rides if you can, makes a difference). Really enjoyed the Paint The Night parade, and like how the fireworks start almost immediately afterwards."
1843,2017-2,"Yes, the lines for attractions can be long but we managed to survive with 3 kids aged 6,8 and 11. The park is clean,safe and very well organised. Plan what attractions you want to see the most and do them as early as possible. Make sure to use your fastpass as often as possible as it will cut down your waiting times by half in most case's.We planned ahead and gave ourselves enough days to do everything we wanted to do. You need a least 3 days to do most things the park has to offer. The parades and the fireworks are brilliant and should not be missed."
1844,2017-2,"I have dreamt about going to Disneyland since a child and it was just as I imagined...wonderful! The facilities and rides are amazing and so well planned. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride was out of this world! I am pregnant and there were several rides I was unable to go on, but the safety guidelines were very well marked on each ride site. The only downside is I think they could give free parking seen as the park admission and food inside is very expensive. Overall a fantastic day and I would highly recommend! "
1845,2017-2,"at the happiest place on Earth!?  Seriously, I don't know who love D Land more, me or my kids.  If you can't have a smile on your face while at D land, you must be dead."
1846,2017-2,"Yeah it's expensive but I personally think it's worth every penny. If you're lucky enough to live in SoCal get a pass! you only have to go 4 times to make the cheapest SoCal pass worth it (I know they used to be cheaper but hey, it's so crowded I kinda understand why they put the prices up) you can't go weekends but who wants to go when it's extra busy anyway :) Disneyland is my favourite  3"
1847,2017-2,"Yes it's crowded. Yes it's expensive. But it delivers. If you leave here without a smile from ear to ear, there's something wrong with you. Try off season and early entry to minimize wait times and crowds."
1848,2017-2,Disneyland has been around for as long as I can remember and it still has the same feel although different. I love the safe feeling we have while inside the park and how clean everything looks to be.
1849,2017-2,We took a family reunion of 12 here. It was magical. We think that the parades and shows are a CAN'T MISS for sure. Dazzling and magic!
1850,2017-3,I took my youngest daughter (11) here and she hasn't been here since she was 5. We had a great experience. I love the fast track and the Disney app that tells you how long a line is. This help me direct my day. Disneyland has so much stuff to offer and any age. Can't wait to come back and visit again. 
1851,2017-3,we took out 5 and 6 year old boys to disney and we got there both times when the park opened. I was running from one ride to another strategically planning how to get a fast pass and not have the kids wait in line for so long. not every ride has a fast pass so.....at one point we waited in line for 90 mins for a ride. the food was not that great there thank god we packed snacks and overall I was disspointed b c we did not get one single picture w  a character. the lines each time were sooo long it was unreal. why would you have this so long for impatient kids? The adults that were visiting the parks were very inconsierate of children and my son got trampled while I was holding his hand and hit w  bags b c his short. for goodness sakes ppl there are little kids here have some sense. 
1852,2017-3,"unless you are a Disney fanatic one day is all you need at Disneyland. we were advised to get a 3 day pass as  there is so much to do . our first day was fantastic, the 2nd we went to Disney California Adventure, which is Ok but can easily be missed as nothing special and on the 3rd we went back to Disneyland. By then we were all Disneyed out. We had done all the rides on the first day, so we spent our time eating, shopping and going on some of the rides more suited for toddlers. The most amazing thing about Disneyland is the detail put into everything, it is amazing. The parades are a must and the fireworks amazing. be prepared to queue, this I expected so I wasn't stressed and Disney is so well organised that the queues move pretty quickly. Having to pay $18us for parking everyday you visit the park is a rip off especially when you consider it costs a family of 4 nearly a $1000us for the 3 day pass. You'd think they could throw in the parking for free. Food and souvenirs are also expensive. so go for one day, do and see as much as you can, go mid week when less crowded, take lots of money, accept that you will be in a lot of queues and have a wonderful time. "
1853,2017-3,"Tips to enjoy Disneyland:1. Go early and take advantage of less crowds and nether parking options. 2. Take advantage of Fast pass by getting passes for those, rides first. 3. Decide what are the must see shows rides attractions and plan around those. 4. The monorail takes you from downtown disney to tomorrow land. Nice if you want to step out for a meal in downtown disney or cou k do be easier access to the park.5. Know that some rides can still be scary for little ones even if they meet the height requirement. So use your best judgment knowing your kid's personality the best. 6. Pack snacks and bring a refillable water bottle   food is pricey and if you and your kiddos want something a little healthier, beat that you being it with you.7. Check out where different characters come out so you can meet your favorite princess, Mickey, Winnie the Pooh, etc.8. Bring a stroller for your little ones. They will get tired and overly excited. Prepare for a meltdown at the happiest place on earth!!"
1854,2017-3,"Love the place and even though we weren't there for Xmas, Jan 2nd all the Christmas feel was still there.  We loved it the 2nd time over just as much as the first."
1855,2017-3,"I have grown up going to Disneyland. As the years have gone by, the park seems to become more and more full. That being said, if you are patience and well informed, you can make the most of your trip. My biggest recommendation is two fold.  First, go early, then take a break so you can stay late. The park starts getting crowded after 10, so if you can, get there when it opens. Take a break in the middle of the day (there is no point in being one of those angry crabby people during fireworks). Come back at around 4 5. You will be refreshed and ready to finish out your trip. Second  PREPLAN   I constantly marvel at people who do not take advantage of Fastpasses, and how many arguments I have heard between families regarding what to do next. Take the time in line to figure out where you want to go next. Be okay with walking back and forth across the park. Also take advantage of the vast number of fan sights that can give you tips on were to sit for fireworks, scheduling of all the street shows and other little tidbits that make Disneyland an immersive experience."
1856,2017-3,"This place is great as always, I love the rides and staying at the Disneyland hotel. These guys know how to move lines, great rides and light shows. Be sure to get fast passes for the big rides to cut time down on the line wait. If you haven't been, look for the deals, plan a budget and save up to have a blast!!! That's how my family and I have been able to do it cuz this place is expensive."
1857,2017-3,"Disneyland offers an experience that takes you back in time to some of your most beloved classics while also mixing in some of the newer hits. Disneyland, California Adventure Park, and Downtown Disney are all side by side so two days is plenty to take it all in!"
1858,2017-3,"What a great trip we just got back. We were there the 18   20th of Jan. Yes, Monday MLK Jr day was a bit crowded, but overall we still had fun. Get your fast pass for space mountain early!!!!The park was clean and so much to see and do. We prefer the thrill rides. Space Mountain, Star Tours, Splash Mountain, Matterhorn, etc. We did not mind waiting in line. Go earlier in the day for shorter lines. (and to get that fast pass for Space Mountain)We also enjoyed the Astro Blasters, Indiana Jones, etc. We did not do many of the true Kiddie rides.Had lunch at the Carnation Caf   one day   it was good food. A little pricey   but not too bad compared to what I expected for eating in the parks.This time of year still needed a light jacket for evenings. Had a great time!"
1859,2017-3,It was very crowded this weekend being it was MLK weekend and RunDisney's Star Wars weekend and Elton John performed. With that we still enjoyed the park. We did the tour Walk in Walts footsteps and that was awesome. The tour included lunch and ended with a tour of the Fantasy Suite. Next visit you make try one of the tours they are fantastic.
1860,2017-3,"As much as I ADORE Disney (I have an ENORMOUS tattoo of the Little Mermaid, all the movies, and plenty of Disney stuff at home), the park wasn't all what I expected it to be. To be honest, I found Sesame Place to be better organized and funner to visit, though I'm not a Sesame Street fan. The staff is amazing, but the park isn't as well organized as I'd expect it to be. The rides   things to visit seem to be kind of smaller and almost not as 'magical' as they should be, in my book. All in all, interesting, but I think it'd be best to try and go to Disney WORLD, if you can. :)"
1861,2017-3,"We had a lot of fun. Star Wars was awesome. Kids loved Jedi Training. Kids thought Disney characters would be walking all over the park, but mainly only in Toontown. Paint the night parade is fantastic as well as fireworks. Fastpass is great idea. Only minus was there were a lot of attractions down for refurbishment going in January."
1862,2017-3,"Overall our experience was disappointing. Because several kid friendly rides were closed, wait times at other rides were 90 120 minutes. Then Star Tours broke down. In addition, the Mexican restaurant had no working heaters on the patio. They claimed that  maintenance  had to relight them, but no one was called. "
1863,2017-3,"This was our second trip to disneyland   the first time was in 2008 when my brother and I were 6 and 10. Though he doesn't remember it, I believe it feels better when its all for the first time and 10 was a good age for that. Our first day was a public holiday so it was really busy and we left early after getting sick of the crowds. We decided last minute to watch the fireworks and found it easy to get front row access to them (standing up). They were amazing, each set to a disney movie with projections on the castle and great music. We went home early every day except our last due to big crowds   WAY too many prams and scooters, clogging up access to walkways and constantly holding up everyone. The parades also caused problems with access due to shutting off the main walkways roads, forcing everyone to push eachother around to get to where they want to go. The rides were good, on average we waited about 20 minutes per one. The wait for Space Mountain was ridiculous   almost an hour and a half (partly due to a breakdown), but 10 15 stand by people were let in for every 50 fast pass people   so I recommend doing fast pass (if you don't know what fast pass is search it up  we thought you had to pay but everyone can do it, made life a lot easier). Food is expensive and most restaurants sit down food places only have 3 food options. Couldn't get photos with any characters as lines were too long or they'd be finishing up. The toilets were well kept and the soap smelt really nice. Good feel through out the park but merchandise is really expensive. Definately recommend the park hopper pass as one park may be busier than the other etc. "
1864,2017-3,"Great time with our 6 yr old during New Year's week (and first week in Tomorrowland after Star Wars opened ;)  Park was extremely crowded, but to be expected considering time of year and Rose Bowl week festivities."
1865,2017-3,Steer clear of the new year time period as we had four days of not being able to access rides and fireworks cancelled with no notification. In queues many times for over an hour to have the ride break down and having to start again. Too many people with rides not always functioning. Was a major disappointment.
1866,2017-3,Visited this place with little children.  Very disappointing that most of the rides and attractions were blocked or closed for renovation.  I was not told that when i booked the tickets online.
1867,2017-3,"We visited the park for our 50th anniversary. It was a great location to relax and see attractions and all that Disney offers. As usual, everything looked perfect. I can't imagine amount of work every day to keep the park looking the way it does. Keep up the good work!"
1868,2017-3,"What a fun surprise to see Sir Elton John in concert while visiting the park!  I can't wait until it appears on television!  Thanks, Disneyland!"
1869,2017-3,"The original, and the best :: everything about this place is fun for children and adults and we loved everything! Even in the rain, we had a great time (and much shorter lines). The evening parade and fireworks show was a real surprise and should not be missed :: it was magical."
1870,2017-3,Was packed what seemed like well over capacity. We left cause it was too much for the kids. Came back the next day and had a wonderful time. Crowd died down and you could actually have space to walk. We got in all the rides so that was fantastic!
1871,2017-4,"For those adults or parents who are unsure about going to Disneyland Park it was well worth the visit.I have one teenage daughter who was very keen to go and a teenage son who was wavering but came so there was company for my daughter. The others were not interested and stayed at home. So Disneyland Park was one of those few attractions were I couldn't get the whole family involved.Well, did they miss out on a great day! We were staying in West Hollywood so had a reasonable drive to get there but timed it perfectly to arrive as the the rides were opening. It is worth saying at this point that it was very well organised to our car spot, on to the tram and then to the ticket booth. A breeze so far.Once the rides opened there was a bit of congestion as the first cars were being filled and started flowing but the wait times were quite reasonable.We were only disappointed on one ride where the wait time far exceeded the published time and we abandoned mid wait so we could go on others.It is not an inexpensive day but an attraction I am extremely glad to have done."
1872,2017-4,We had a blast during our trip to California. It was interesting comparing the differences in the original park i.e. Disneyland to WDW since we have annual passes there and visit there. I really enjoyed Hyperspace Mountain and the theming that was done there. It was a blast from the past using the paper Fastpasses again. The characters were awesome and the rides were loads of fun.
1873,2017-4,"We spent Christmas and New Years in Disneyland. We did an 11 day trip and purchased the 5 day hopper park pass and went off site on the other 6 days. Knowing we were going in the most busiest time of the year we were not surprised about the crowds. BUT you MUST at least once experience Disneyland at the Holidays. It is magical and the holiday decorations are amazing. They have the Christmas parade in addition to the Paint the Night parade and even California Adventure has a holiday World of Color show. Aside from the wait time my kids 5 and 12 had a blast!Most lines for rides were about 1.5 to 2 hours, even using Fast Pass we missed our fast pass times waiting in line for other rides. However I thought even though the wait was long that you were still moving. The food at the Plaza Inn is great. Other than that we only got quick bites at the turkey leg, hot dog stands. In Fantasyland they have a stand that has humus and fresh fruits which was great.The shopping was fun, a lot of repeats however Frontierland was my favorite with a lot of old west themed items. Also to find a store that embroiders your name on your Mickey ears are not easily found but Mad Hatter at the beginning of Main St has a huge selection and are fast.The parades were awesome but had to sit in our spot about 1.5 hours before it began, if not you will not be able to see as the crowds were so huge.We didn't see a lot of characters around the park ,however the character breakfast at Plaza Inn had 12  characters each day we went. My daughter met Minnie, Chip & Dale, Eeyore, Pooh, Tigger, Captain Hook, Peter Pan, Max, the mice of Cinderella, Rafiki. Our second breakfast there we were one of the last people there so Pooh & Tigger were playing charades with my son & husband on who their favorite characters in Star Wars are.The Sky Launch Bay in Tommorowland is a must do, no lines unless you want to be a Jedi and good shopping for Star Wars and Super hero items. They have xbox area that my 12 year was excited with.Glad we got to experience Autotopia, Fantastmic, Jungle Cruise, Mark Twain Riverboat & Pirates Lair on Tom Sawyers Island and they are all closed for an undisclosed time with exception of Autotopia to make way for the new Star Wars Land. Sadly, Big Thunder Ranch will be closed permanently for Star Wars Land.Take a stroller if you have young kids, my daughter is 5 and fought me in the beginning of riding in stroller because she is not a baby but both us were so glad we bought one, after standing line for 2 hours she was ready to be pushed around, it was safer too when the crowds were large (after a show or parade) that we didn't get separated by all the people pushing to get out.For that you can do and see the cost of admission to me is fair. The food and shopping are expensive but its Disney its worth it."
1874,2017-4,2nd time to disneyland and we had such a great time!! Lines were much less of a wait than what the time stated so that made it a breeze! We enjoyed this trip so much and the customer service was outstanding! Be sure if you have a little girl to do the bipiddi boppity boutique as it is a magical experience for them :) 
1875,2017-4,"Disney is by far the best of the best! They have done an amazing work in updating the park! The new star wars area is amazing! The park is clean, there is a lot of help from the staff. Micky is always available for pictures and hugs. The parade is great and the fireworks show is insaine! Disneyland Park is a must!"
1876,2017-4,"We usually enjoy going to Disneyland but this is the last time we go on a weekend. We went from Thursday thru Saturday. We had a great time on Thursday because the crowds didn't show till Friday and Saturday. They also had several attractions closed so that just loads up the rest of the park. The food is always good especially a Dole whip in the afternoon. Next time we visit, it'll be during the middle of the week, late fall. We're looking forward to the new Star Wars area too."
1877,2017-4,Awesome...some excessive lines at stores and food shops but the regular happy fare. I sincerely do not regret taking my 4 year old there other than not having him want to go on some great rides and shows offered.
1878,2017-4,"This was my seventh visit and my Son's first. I very much enjoyed all the parades and experiences. Every time I go there is something new, Kind of bitter sweet to see some of the older stuff go but they justify it with keeping things fresh."
1879,2017-4,"When we got there, the parking took really long! You have to take a shuttle to the Park and then stand in line for the tickets. The park has different themes like Frontier Land, Tomorrow Land, Fantasy Land, etc. There are queues everywhere and you have to wait for anywhere between 20 to 100 minutes to get on to one of the rides. You also have to wait for in long queues to eat at one of the many restaurants in the park. We watched a film called 'Path of the Jedi' which was pretty good (and just about 15 minutes of waiting). Be prepared to walk a lot :) We spent a lot of time contemplating on which ride to take (since all the rides had really long waits), but finally gave up and took the one called Hyperspace Mountain, which had a 100 minute wait time. The ride itself was about 5 10 minutes long, but pretty thrilling and I'd say, worth the wait! The highlight of the show however was the parade at night in front of the Sleeping Beauty castle, with several floats carrying Disney Characters. The final four characters were Goofy, Donald Duck, Minnie Mouse, and Mickey Mouse (who for certain was the star of the show). The lighting for this parade was awesome.Finally came the firework display with sounds and projections on the castle, which is worth the wait. If you are not willing to spend an entire day at the park, come around noon and make sure you are done with your rides and dinner before 8 pm !!"
1880,2017-4,Spend an enjoyable day but half of it was spent in queues. Many rides were not operating. Food was expensive and fatty and sugary. It seems it caters best for 5 10 year olds. The fireworks were fabulous.
1881,2017-4,"Great time to visit as the crowds were low. BEST part was the Parade. Be sure and get a spot on main street where you can sit on the curb and enjoy the FANTASTIC lights, songs & show! So great! The fireworks over the CASTLE was pretty fabulous too! "
1882,2017-4,"My daughter wanted to celebrate her 10th birthday at Disneyland after hearing all of her friends rave about it. I only relented after finding a sweet package deal with SW airlines AND because it was during the winter months. There was no way I would go during the summer with the sweltering heat and long lines. My kids (ages 10 and and 5) were unimpressed except with Star Tours (make sure to get the free fast pass otherwise you will wait in line forever). Speaking of the Star Tours ride, may the force (and patience) be with you if your child wants to build his her own lightsaber. After the ride as with many of the main attractions, you will end up in one of the theme stores. There is lightsaber building section which can be maddening as the instructions aren't very clear on how to build the darn thing and you have a bunch of kids pushing and shoving to get their parts. I was hoping it would be like Build a Bear where you get all the parts and they assemble it for you. Felt as if most of the rides at Disneyland was a bit outdated and stale. That being say one of the rides I did enjoy was the  It's a small world  as it was so outdated it was almost quaint. Overall impression is that the park can be a bit crowded even when we went during the non peak times. Lots of little kids and babies especially for those slower rides. We had more fun at Disneyland California Adventures. Pretty good military discount (up to six tickets) which you can purchase at any of the the ticket windows. "
1883,2017-4,"Decided to go to the park last minute due to being stuck in town for work. Bought a day pass on Sunday and had an amazing time, staff was exceptionally friendly and courteous. The only disappointment was several rides were closed but with so many others open we wouldn't have time to do them all in one day anyway. This was a last minute vacation for myself, my husband and our son. The Village Haus eatery was absolutely terrible. Terrible! We waited 94 minutes for 2 burgers and a kids pizza totaling $40. It was busy but people who ordered after us received their food before we did and they were ordering the same items (selection is limited). The Bengal barbecue had beef skewers that were amazing!!! Wished we had chosen that for lunch instead. Tips for your visit: bring your own drinks and snacks. They no longer honor free refills if you purchase the memorabilia mugs. All drinks are $3.25  $8.00 without the specialty mugs  thermoses etc. Saw several people with their own snacks and wished we had packed a bag ourselves. The fireworks display was beautiful and heartwarming. The parades were exciting, lines weren't long. If you have trouble walking they can provide electric and electric scooters. If handicap, ask you have to do is seek a cast member at the exit to the ride you prefer and they will scan your park ticket and hold your place in line freeing up your time to visit the shops, eateries, etc. For an impromptu vacation, this was a great one. "
1884,2017-4,I've visited Disneyland with my wife prior to having children and now we've visited again with our 18 month old. Being a long weekend the lines were extra long but we enjoyed several child appropriate rides in fantasyland. Our son wasn't overly thrilled but loved the day and night parades. There are plenty of food options for toddlers. Unfortunately the baby change facilities were quite dirty. Locker hire was very helpful and there is plenty of space to leave strollers whilst standing in line. All in all it was a great day out as expected. 
1885,2017-4,"Perfect and Incredible 3Days... My family and I spent the right days at the parks, we stayed at the Ramada Plaza I cannot say enough great things about the hotel and the parks. It truly is a magical place. The parks are always very well kept, the staff go above and beyond and the rides are a blast."
1886,2017-4,"The Disney Magic is alive and well in Disneyland. The imagineers and cast members excellently craft rides and experiences that will transport you. Now if they can actually transport you around the park (railroad was not running when we were there, nor were quite a few other attractions, including one of my faves from Disneyworld  Haunted mansion ) with people movers, or bike cabs, or something, perhaps they could abolish the overwhelming number of exhausted adults and kids wilting on every single bench, chair, curb, etc. throughout the park. That said, we all slept like babies after our two long days at the park.I was traveling with my husband (we're both 50) and our 14 and 12 year old kids. We realized quickly that our kids had outgrown QUITE a few of the attractions, and were mainly interested in the big thrill rides. In some ways, that was a good thing, since the lines for the big thrill rides are incessant on a crowded January holiday weekend. We succeeded in using the fastpass system for early rides on Hyperspace Mountain (my fav) and Indiana Jones. We opted to wait until the end of the night during the fireworks to stand in an hour long (better than the over 2 hour wait earlier) final ride on Hyperspace mountain. What a blast!Our other favorites here were Thunder Mountain Railroad (used fastpass to ride 2x) and SPlash Mountain (did the same). We also did a first thing in the morning Peter Pan, which was sweet fun, but we wouldn't spend 45  minutes in line for it later in the day. The line was 15 miins first thing in the am. We did a few other quiet rides in between fastpasses. The kids liked Matterhorn, but it was too bumpy and uncomfortable for us old folk. I'm glad we did the park experience since we are living temporarily in SoCal. But for the expense ($600 so cal passes for the family for two days   $115 a night in hotel   expensive disney mediocre food) I think we won't return. Probably need to do a six flags instead to keep up with the kids' need for speed. Great thing to do once though!"
1887,2017-4,"The last showing for the parades and fireworks are definitely way less crowded. Also, you'll want to get a fast pass for space mountain since this is the longest wait time at this park. Loved the Indiana Jones ride! Get in single riders if you want to ride faster. "
1888,2017-4,After traveling to many different places in America recently we decided to visit Disneyland and California Park at the end of our trip before returning to Australia. We were very disappointed when we arrived with prepaid tickets to find out that between the two parks there were 12 major rides closed. I cannot understand how they can charge the same price and close so many attractions?We complained but very little understanding or compassion was shown. I will certainly be advising anyone who is planning to visit to phone before buying tickets to find out which rides are not operating.
1889,2017-4,I loved visiting Disneyland even though I only had about half of one day to visit. I would recommend spending at least 2 days and get a park hopper ticket so you can go in between Disneyland and California Adventure during the day and spend more time at parts of the parks that you end up enjoying more.The cleanliness and feel of Disney is something that has to be experienced to fully understand.Truly the only unpleasant part of the Disney experience is the cost   it is becoming virtually impossible for the average family to actually afford without accumulating some form of debt.
1890,2017-4,The rides and food are great the park was very clean and friendly but the next time gonna pick a warmer time to go
1891,2017-4,"We love Disneyland! So clean, amazing, fun, magical and AMAZING! You will be happy here!!!! Pricey but worth every penny!"
1892,2017-5,"This park is a little smaller (castle also smaller) than the Magic Kingdom in Florida, but many of the attractions are the same (and in the same places). It is magical for all ages, but part of the park is closed for refurbishment (adding Star Wars Land   can't wait!!). Tomorrowland has been Star Wars ized, which made Space Mountain extremely cool and way more fun than the generic space ride it has been for 40 years. Star Tours was even updated for the new The Force Awakens movie with Finn and BB8. Just need to ditch Jar Jar Binks   can't believe he's still in this attraction. Star Wars music and characters abound. If you are not a Star Wars nut (which I am) you may not like the changes, but we loved them. Indiana Jones (which is a great franchise) was a little underwhelming. It needs some new technology. It is similar to the Dino ride at Animal Kingdom but nowhere near as fun . We unfortunately missed the parades, which are always great. But we did see a ton of characters. If you have girls, visit the Royal Hall where you can see 3 princesses in one place. Very cool and a special experience. Snow White and Cinderella were  in character  and spot on. Use the Fast Pass system   still baffles me that most do not. Very weird that people will stand in line for over and hour when they can Fast Pass and go do something else and come back a little later and walk on the ride in 5 minutes, even on busy days. Wanted to ride the Bobsleds but the line was always really long and no Fast Passes (not sure why). Great experience and love having the two parks side by side for easy access and touring, With Downtown Disney also right there and pairing it all with the Grand Californian next door   what's not to like!!! "
1893,2017-5,We enjoyed everything of Disneyland. The parade and fireworks are very impressive. I would suggest visitors really stay inside the park for the fireworks. I heard people telling me they could watch fireworks from their hotel but it is totally different when it is watched from inside the park. The music and lights makes the fireworks really breathtaking. 
1894,2017-5,"We have spent quite a bit of time in Disneyworld and were very excited to have a chance to visit Disneyland in California. It did not disappoint. From the moment we walked in (no tram required), we felt as though we were seeing Disney the way that Walt Disney would have wanted us to see it. First, everything is smaller in terms of park size. There are only two major parks at Disneyland   the Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure Park. There is NOT Epcot, Hollywood Studios, Animal Kingdom. Even Disney Magic Kingdom is very different from Disneyland Park. The DL park offers a variety of themes and rides. If you can imagine everything that is your favorite about Orlando, put it into one park and add a hefty dose of nostalgia, than that is what you will find at DL. Rides that no longer exist at DW are still at DL... we took a submarine ride (used to be 20.000 leagues under the sea and is now Finding Nemo, a canoe ride to Tom Sawyer's Island and even Mr. Toad's Wild ride. Plus, there is a Bobsled right that is ONLY at DL as well as the original Carosel that Mrs. Disney used to ride   complete with her favorite horse. The major disappointment was It's a Small World. It is indeed a small world at DL and many of the wall were doll free, painted black. We also saw the underside of the ride which was a wall opened for boats that needed repair. Sad to float by and to see the broken boats, half sunk in terrible disrepair. We did however have fun walking through the Pirate's of the Caribbean, the Haunted Mansion and Indiana Jones Adventure   completely different than the tired stage show at DW. You do not want to miss anything here. Even though we knew we were not going to eat at Peco's Bill, we found the Stagecoach stop to be charming and delicious. Overall, it was a wonderful experience and one that we will be hoping to have again in the future. Five stars!!!"
1895,2017-5,"It is just as clean and pristine as I remember (DCA next door, not quite as tidy). Cast members are helpful and kind. Some rides may have changed, but the vibe is still the same for the next generation. Got a horrible caricature that looks nothing like my niece (I mean NOTHING) for $19.95. They wrote her name on it after we asked them not to do so. Got a beautiful silhouette on Main Street that captured her perfectly (two for $9.95). Recommend the silhouette."
1896,2017-5,My wife was on a business trip in LA so I tagged along for a long weekend and we planned Saturday for Disneyland! It was like we were kids again! The only thing we missed was having our children with us but we still had a great day!
1897,2017-5,"I love Disneyland. I have been going there since it opened. However, when the cost is so high, the experience needs to be worth the price. First is parking. If you want to be there when the park opens you need to be to parking at least a half hour early, 45 mins. would probably be best. The freeway and road signs are confusing and direct you through a maze of streets, signals and construction. There is so much commercial build up all around the park that you can not tell where it is! When you finally get to parking, you are a long distance away from the parks entrance and in your first of many long, slow lines. Then you wait for a shuttle bus that interior smells like urine. After being dropped off the confusion begins. No signs direct you to the next step which is TSA like security. Do not go to the long lines at the gate if you do not already have a ticket. Find the ticket booths, again no signage, buy the expensive tickets, then go get in the long slow line to actually get into the park. Once inside immediately run to your favorite ride and then immediately get a fast pass to do it again. Keep tour eyes open at all time to avoid colliding with the army of strollers every where. We went on a Thursday. It was crowded but we were able, with good planning and strategies, to ride all our favorites twice, go on a couple of rides that are not top tier for a total of 14 rides in 10 hours. But leaving was as frustrating as our arrival. No signage to get us to the departure shuttles, a ride on another urine smelling bus and back onto the confusing maze of streets to get back to Grandmas. We will go again but would return sooner if getting into and out of the park was not so stressful!!!!"
1898,2017-5,"3 days of which 2 were in pouring rain. Turns out the queues are much smaller, especially for Splash mountain (I guess some people can't take the cold and wet!) so we just walked on whenever we felt like it. Seeing the Xmas decorations was lovely and the parade and fireworks were amazing."
1899,2017-5,"It's hard to beat a Disneyland vacation if you have young children. There is truly something for everyone here and Disney is the best at providing an exceptional family experience.We travelled with our 5 year old and infant this year and split 3 days between the Disneyland park and California adventure using a Park Hopper pass.The rider switch pass allowed both parents to enjoy the park with our older daughter, and our baby was able to enjoy many of he rides with us so that the whole family could stay together.The park is clean, safe, and full of fun & surprises. I've been coming here since I was a child and it still is he same magic. It's the perfect place to make memories!The diamond celebration fireworks show was incredible this year...this especially made this trip special."
1900,2017-5,"Different experience from Orlando, but still a Disney experience. Fantasmic Show followed by the fireworks is a good option for night entertainment. Be sure to wear warm clothes if you are visiting during winter times."
1901,2017-5,"We are a family of 4 ( 10 yr old boy & 13 yr old boy). We visit theme parks all over & whenever we can. I read reviews prior to our California vacation & all I want to know is who are these people giving this place great reviews! Our family all agreed after a very long terrible experience at Disneyland that this is one of the poorest theme parks we have even attend. Don't waste your time and money here and here are a few reasons why.1. Get their early and you will still park up high and even further away,,, which makes no sense. 2. Crowds were terrible! Don't believe the Crowd tracker sites!! Doesn't help most half the kiddie rides were closed,,, and yes Disneyland has only Kiddie rides. Not even some good ones for the big kids to enjoy like at Disney World. 3. Oh and again more than half the rides were closed and not worth the $$$$$. The only reason we were there so long was because of the lines. 4. None of the rides were as good or better than any other theme park we have been too. Our kids had more fun at Santa Monica Pier where they sale all ride bracelets for $30.00. 5. Safety violations everywhere and won't even go into that.6. Did not see one character in real life all day!!7. the employee did not exhibit the Happy work attitude you would expect. 8. Food was okay & that is where they make a lot of money.9. Got herded around like cattle because they were making a movie so we the paying customers weren't important enough to care about at that point. We were herded out like cattle though a 20 ft area, major fire hazard. 10. since so many rides were shut down they gave a fireworks show (which they should not matter what) 11. Star wars hyperspace (old Space mountain) was disappointing. 12. The park was lacking in beautiful landscaping that other parks have. The only great thing here was the dang Ice Cream which was a pain to get too because it was blocked off for taping. I could go on and on but I think that is enough.We left this place so stressed, ripped off and frustrated that after this experience my kids were given the choice to come back the next day to visit adventure land.... none of us wanted to go back to this park or any Disney park. We went to Santa Monica Pier which was awesome !! The only thing MAGIC here are the good reviews, probably by people that don't visit many parks through out US and want to believe there is still magic at Disney. Wish we had known the negatives prior to spending money & time at this place!"
1902,2017-5,"So my husband and I purposely chose to visit Disneyland the day after the kids have to go back to school after Winter break, in the hope that it would be less crowded. Turned out Disneyland is never not crowded, despite whatever day of the week it is!!! But still, it was a lot of fun.We got there half an hour before they opened so my husband could go on his most favorite ride of them all: Indiana Jones. It was a good idea because the ride filled up pretty quickly! We maxed out our chances with the Fastpass. Whoever thought of this idea is a Genius! We were able to enjoy lots of rides without wasting too much time waiting in lines, and it felt really good! My only complain is the Peter Pan ride. We waited 1hr there for a ride that is less than 3 minutes long. I was very upset about that. If only they could make it a little faster or easier with the Fastpass, that would be much appreciated! One more thing is it was very weird when everything there, from background music to the parade was still in Christmas theme. Even Santa Claus was there in January!!! I thought I was done with Christmas already... Oh well!My husband and I enjoyed our day at the Disneyland a lot. It was a lot of rides and excitement. We will be back!"
1903,2017-5,We are having a blast!! We have a 3 year old and just to see him this happy is awesome. I am not sure why we waited so long to come down here. I would recommend to anyone bring your walking shoes. I would also like to say I am very impressed at the professionalism of all staff when it comes to people in wheel chairs they are helpful and accommodating hats off to the employees. 
1904,2017-5,"I grew up going to Disneyland, but things have changed so much. The CROWDS, the lines, the prices are horrific. Now there are over 15 rides closed between Disneyland and California Adventure for  refurbishment  and the STar Wars addition. If they lowered the prices, I would respect them, but no, Disney raised the prices. This is such an abuse of the families who save all year to take their kids to Disney and then find out it's too crowded or many of the main rides are closed. Use your money to travel somewhere else."
1905,2017-5,"They continue to maintain the level of excellence expected from Disney. We were off peak so lines were not so oppressive except on the most popular rides. They are building the new Star Wars land so some rides were closed for that. A few rides were closed for the transition back from the holiday theme. Autopia was closed for refurbishing (they really need to get rid of those two stroke engines). So some of the experience was lacking. There was still enough to have a good time. Between Fast Pass and smaller crowds we were able to go on a lot of rides more than once. Almost every experience was more accessible. There were just a few missing. Off peak is the way to go if you can.The 60th Anniversary fireworks show is very good. The experience is enhanced by seeing it in the park, especially from Main Street where the show plays off the buildings. We stayed at the Grand Californian Hotel which gives you an extra hour some mornings. It's also good for taking a midday break. They have tightened security more so be prepared for a TSA like experience getting in. They pull out random people for secondary checks although I'm not sure how random they were when my son got pulled twice and I got pulled once on a two day visit. I guess it's what the world has become. Bring your patience as  The Happiest Place on Earth  can make you less than happy getting in. Still it is Disneyland and the annoyance wears off by the time you get down Main Street. "
1906,2017-5,"I am 50 years old and am still lost if I don't go to Disneyland every year.  Can't wait for Star Wars Land to open and that will be my next visit.  Even in the rain, there is plenty to do."
1907,2017-5,"Highly recommend Disneyland. We visited the day after a winter storm in California. No lines. I recommend Indiana Jones, Thunder Mountain and the tomorrowland area which is now heavily focused on all things Star Wars. The newly updated Star Tours ride is really cool and fun. Space Mountain incorporates Star Wars music and themes. Overall a very exciting park, fun for all ages. Use one of the many apps out there to figure out wait times to make your day more efficient. We've been dozens of times and never tire of this park. FANTASTIC!"
1908,2017-5,"We turned the worst rainstorm into the best day! There were some problems including ride closures to keep foot traffic moving and early closing of restaurants to accommodate low park attendance. The perks  10 minutes to wait for Splash Mountain, 20 minutes for Indiana, and 5 minutes for the Big Thunder Mountain (best!). There is a considerable number of Gluten Free options including the holy grail of caramel apples. Yes, a GF caramel apple. Disney is the land of GF dreams and you're welcome. "
1909,2017-5,"We went from 31 December to 4 January. New Years Eve is the busiest day of the year so the crowds were huge but with the RideMax software we managed to dodge the queues and still get in a full day of rides and parades. If you are going in the busy season get the app.As for the park itself, it is the happiest place on Earth. All staff are friendly and visiting should be on everyone's bucket list."
1910,2017-5,Disney has really gone all out on their Diamond 60th Celebration. The Paint the Night Parade is awesome. A great spot to watch is A Small World especially for the first Parade as that is the starting spot. Get there about 30 minutes before it starts. The fire works is the best that I have ever seen. Get a spot on the centre and middle of Main Street about 20 mins before it starts. It is well worth the wait. The rides are typical but many closed for refurbishment and the building of the new Star Wars area. Updates to Space Mountain and Star Tours are great. Launch Bay had some amazing stuff. Worth a look. Get there early and stay there late. Make the $100.00 day worth it. Disney rarely disappoints.
1911,2017-5,"Take a trip down memory lane with this beautiful theme park. Exploring the rides as a 28 old year old brought back memories from childhood. Adults can definitely enjoy all the rides, but there's enough whoosh and zoom on the Indiana Jones ride to satisfy those looking for excitement. I'd recommend taking two days to do it properly. "
1912,2017-5,"The Knights Inn was cute, small, clean and comfy. The staff was very accommodating and awesome. They made my daughter's birthday extra special. My 9 yr old daughter and I went for her 9th birthday. The two of us stayed a total of 2 nights 3 days. We flew in early on a Thursday and enjoyed her birthday at Disneyland from open to close on the first day. (WEAR COMFY WALKING SHOES) we went 7th of January after the rush of holiday and before the rides shut down for maintenance. It was perfect timing and  slow  according to the employees. Average wait was 15 30min for attractions. We got to do 23 different attractions when they usually try to get each guest 7. We used fast passes a lot. Cast members were all extremely nice. They gave my daughter two buttons for her birthday and 1st time there. The park was open 9am 11pm thursday Jan 7th.The next day we on Friday the 8th we slept in until 12pm and took the ART bus to California adventure. this day was much busier so we got to about 8 attractions. (USE THE FAST PASSES). We didn't get to the most popular ride, CARS. that was almost a 2 hour wait... The employee said fast passes are gone by 11am. Staff members are not as friendly as Disneyland. Although we were able to get into Ariel's Grotto for the princess dinner without dinner when they usually require a reservation. Totally worth the $$. Food was mediocre but my daughter almost cried meeting all the princesses. Our last day saturday we were exhausted considering all the walking the two days before. so we hung out at the library for a low key time until our flight home. Printed our boarding tickets then headed to the airport.Stayed January 2016"
1913,2017-6,"It's Disneyland, what more is there to say?  Walt's park opened in 1955 and has been delighting guests for 60 years now.  So many great rides and so much fun to be had."
1914,2017-6,"Enjoyed our day at Disneyland , hadn't been since a kid in the 1970 s so much had changed but also much remained. Was really disappointed at some of the older rides being temporarily closed... Jungle boat cruise and haunted mansion .... But still enjoyed many others. We went off peak and queues for the more popular rides were up to an hour and a half long! So we skipped some of them. Can see why the front of line passes are popular . Food was expensive but good to see you could buy healthy food including fresh fruit in places. Some of the lines offered single riders express so for. Indiana Jones we waited perhaps 15  20 mins instead of 45. It cooled down significantly in the evening so take something warmer to wear. Hire of mobility scooters for $75 day ( includes a $20 deposit) and wheelchairs for $ 30 ish , pushers also available to hire , can't remember how much but cheaper again .... Good access for many of the rides. A day worth doing and while we didn't get to everything we felt we saw enough in a day. Don't feel the need to go back again for ourselves but when the time comes will take grand kids."
1915,2017-6,"True to form, the park is beautiful and fun.  The fast pass system really works well too! The employees were super nice as well.  It seems that folks really love their jobs."
1916,2017-6,"Our visit to the park was filled with the traditional mad dash to get hear and there. Fast passes are essential (if you don't want to wait in lines, but they do not completely eliminate waits. Food is locally unique (within the various areas), but there are common options available in many establishments.The cost of admission seems quite high, but multi day options make it marginally more palatable."
1917,2017-6,"As an annual pass holder, I obviously LOVE Disneyland! I've been at every different time of the year you could think of. Here are some of my best quick tips!1. If you are going to spend more than one day or plan to come back with in the year, buy and annual pass.   Disneyland tickets are expensive, this is not new news to anyone. Investing in an annual pass is a great idea, especially for SOCAL residents. You can park hop with an annual pass and receive discounts through out the parks and hotels.   Purchasing Tickets Always get the park hopper. Yes, it is more expensive, but its worth it to go to both parks, if you are spending more than one day you can opt for doing one park per day if you would like, and I would suggest purchasing before online. 2. When to go? Its well known that Disneyland is visited all year round, however, there are peak seasons. Try to avoid the park at this time if possible. My favorite times to visit are during the week Tues Thurs in Jan, Feb, Oct, Nov. If you want to see the parks at Christmastime, go before everyone is off school for winter break...the second week of december on a tues or weds is usually a safe bet. The parks are crowded during Christmas and New Years.  Since its Southern California the weather is usually good and on the warmer side most of the year. If you are traveling to the parks in the Summer season end of may beg of Aug it will be warm, bring the sunblock and a light sweater for evening if you get cold easily like me.  DONT LET THE RAIN SCARE YOU AWAY.  It doesn't rain often, but if its raining you better believe I'm there. The parks are what I would consider  empty  on rainy days...Most of the attractions are inside or covered so you don't have to worry about it too much and the lines are always short! I've been on Sunday's (which are usually a busy day) but the rain tends to scare people off so it felt like we had the park to ourselves. Superbowl Sunday and Play offs If you don't have big plans to watch the big games, consider going to the parks on these Sunday's if you can't make the trip during the week.  Just about every holiday is busy, I stay away from the parks on these days. 3. Must dos? Parades, get a good seat if you have kiddos. If you are with a group take turns saving your spot. I usually go with my daughter and we get ice cream and relax for awhile in our spot. I would say grab a spot at least 30 min before if you are there on a not so busy day, and at least an hour on a busy day, sometimes an hour and a half for a prime sitting spot.  If you aren't into watching the parades, this is a good time to ride some rides. A lot of areas are roped off and a good chunk of people are watching the parade so the ride lines aren't as crowded, especially on a winter weekday.  Fast Passes. These are a must if you're visiting on a weekend or peak season day. Even if you are there on a not so busy day or time they are still a good idea. But if you plan your trip right, you won't need them! Winter weekdays especially in California Adventure are quite dead, so rides like Screamin and Tower or Terror you can walk right on or wait no more than 10 min for. 4.Just for the Kids? No way! Some of my best disney trips have been adults only! California adventure has some great spots for wine and beer, a yummy Rita stop, and fun rides for adults. Disneyland has fabulous eats and classic must do rides that call for height requirements :) 5.Eats? I've never been disappointed by a Disney snack or meal. My favorites are a turkey leg in California Adventure, churros from either park, a mickey pretzel, and some ice cream. Both parks offer the same snacks. But its smart to bring your own as well, especially if you are traveling with kids, not to mention the prices of food in the parks are pretty steep. I usually eat before entering the parks and have snacks through out the day. If we want an actual meal we usually head to downtown Disney then make our way back into the parks.My best advice is to visit the parks during the off season anytime during the winter on a weekday. The summer months are packed, even during the week. Make sure your bellies are full before going into the park and bring snacks for yourself and the kiddos if you don't want to spend a ton of money. When going to the parks with my daughter (age 5) I bring dollar store glow sticks so shes somewhat distracted from all the overpriced light up toys on every corner... doesn't always work but it helps. Always bring a light jacket if you plan on staying through nightfall, and you don't have to wear tennis shoes, I've done the parks in sandals, but make sure your shoes are comfortable because you will be walking standing most of the day. Bring a water bottle with you, you can refill them throughout the parks. If you are traveling with a group, designate a meeting spot, because no matter how many cell phones you have or how close you plan to stay, something always seems to happen and its good to have a place to go just in case. If you are debating on whether or not a trip to Disneyland is worth it, hands down it is! Even if you have to go in the peak season its still a great time!"
1918,2017-6,"We went up to Disneyland (from San Diego) for a short daytrip with my brother in law and sister in law. They hadn't been to the park for almost 40 years. My husband and I were happy to play tour guide for them. We arrived early, right when people were just being let in the gates. We headed straight for Indiana Jones and were among the first people to get on the ride. We were able to get through a lot of rides in the first couple of hours, before it started to get crowded. We got to ride everything we wanted to except the Haunted Mansion, which unfortunately broke down while were in line. Despite that, we had a really great day! I just love Disneyland!"
1919,2017-6,"While this park is crammed into the city and a bit more confusing to get to than Disney World, it is more consolidated and easier to maneuver. The lines weren't extremely long and we were actually completely done with the park by late afternoon instead of the 12  hours needed at Disney World. The crowds weren't bad either. They have implemented new security measures with bag checks and metal detectors. While it is a welcome safety measure, the process is not very fluid or efficient. It will probably improve over time. Loved all the classic rides. They have not implemented the updated Fast Pass system that Disney World has. It is still and expensive day at an amusement park."
1920,2017-6,"We visited Disneyland on New Year's Day and immediately noticed the difference between DCA and Disneyland: this place is way more crowded than its younger sibling but justly so    it's even more magical. The rides are outstanding (our favorites were Indiana Jones Adventure, Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion, Space Mountain and Star Tours) and the parades (especially the Paint the Night one) and shows (e.g. Fantasmic!) were dazzling. We only had one day to visit the park and though we were up and running from 8am till 10:30pm, using Fastpasses all the time, we did not manage to see and do everything we wanted. Our favorite area was Tomorrowland because we are big Star Wars fans and we could have easily spent the whole day there. The kids got to do the Jedi Training Academy (if you want to do that, make sure you sign up your kids early in the day) and they loved it. The big disappointment of the day was the fireworks, which were canceled 5 minutes before they were supposed to take place because of some wind (which was non existent in our opinion)."
1921,2017-6,My girlfriend and i are in our twentys and we had a ball. We come at night and we did the park in 3 hours. Although we did go on all the rides we still had a blast. THE FIREWORKS. O.M.G they are the best i have ever seen 
1922,2017-6,"Having purchased a 4 day ticket we spent the first 2 days in Disneyland. Because of the way it has been structured and laid out there is no simple way to complete one area before moving onto the next because there simply is not enough time.We picked Space Mountain to visit first then moved through most of the other popular rides.We found the food expensive, with poor options for vegetarians."
1923,2017-6,Hot but nice to visit.. crowded is unavoidable.. everything very fresh.. will visit again in other country..
1924,2017-6,"Have to queue for most of the attractions. Wear comfortable shoes and prepare to queue all day. Food is really expensive and outside food and drinks are not allowed. They do check your bags before you go in. The queue to go in is long but they managed that quite efficiently. Souvenirs are pricey too. Overall, I had fun but had to queue a lot "
1925,2017-6,"Will never get tired of HK disneyland. Visited this as a solo traveler last October 2016 and I will be back in Feb 2018 with family to celebrate my nephews first birthday. To those who plan to visit, make sure you know the schedule of the parades and make sure you wait for the fireworks display!!! It is indeed, magical!"
1926,2017-6,A year ago we were given the chance to visit this wonderful place for everyone . Hongkong Disneyland is the most accessible Disney place we can ever visit since from The Philippines it is just 2 hours away and we were given the opportunity to travel with friends and new found friends . It was a nice place for kids and kids at heart. We might go back and bring along our children so we can enjoy the moment with them . Money is an issue but if you really want to experience this kind of adventure might as well start saving from now so you would be able to reach a goal of fulfillment . What are you waiting for . Lets visit Hongkong Disneyland and feel like a child again for just a day or two .
1927,2017-6,"Great theme park, children fun, overcrowded, you queue for ages on most attractions..Disney prices are not for the faint hearted!"
1928,2017-6,Visited this Disney land when it first originally open and again when I returned to Hong Kong. Really lovely themes but it was small compared to other Disney theme parks. Also very small compared to Ocean Park which is the better of the two in Hong Kong.
1929,2017-6,"Hong Kong is incomplete without visiting Disneyland, this is one of the best Disneyland I have been to, I enjoyed every moment of it. Everyone should go and enjoy the experience, out of everything I did in Hong Kong, I had the most fun over here."
1930,2017-6,"We insisted on reaching the place even when it was occasionally physicalThe train ride was an experience in itself. The train with Mickey Mouse characters and my girl was all excited (me too)The park is stunning, invested, the film screened dazzling with smells, wonderful that make the experience extraordinary. All the facilities are great, Winnie the Pooh, the teacups, the parachute, the roller coaster, the restaurants are good.We spent a whole day in Disney Park and I would stay longer.Absolutely stunning and worth every minute"
1931,2017-6,I have been to Walt Disney World in Orlando since I was 7 years old until I was 39 years old and HK's Disneyland was agreat stop for me at the age of 46. Never stop dreaming!
1932,2017-6,Excellent place with whole day long full of entertainment. Must go recommended place in HK for the family with kids.
1933,2017-6,We went here while on a short stop over to United States. Indeed the happiest place on earth!!!  ) Quite small compared to other Disney Park but the experience is still the same.
1934,2017-7,Made a quick plan and visited Hong Kong plus explore Disney Park. Was amazing and kids geared up with excitement. Stay in this theme hotel was a worth as kids had a real fun time with Mickey & team..Experience was amazing..
1935,2017-7,"Small place and lots of people, Have to line everywhere and every programme...But people were happy, a magic place worth to go..."
1936,2017-7,"Not a true disney exoerience; it's like a classic franchise concept... doesn't have the same charm or depth as the US or Japanese Disney's and having done them all, definitely the lowest from a thrilling day out standpoint. Expensive day out and can get very busy. "
1937,2017-7,We like to bring our son to HK Disneyland.. He likes it a lot. There are rides that are suitable for my 2 year old. We once saw the afternoon parade it was great!
1938,2017-7,"True to its promise, Disneyland is one of the best places to visit even for the young at heart. By the way, do you know that senior citizens (65 years old and above) get big discounts in their ticket. Also, the Mickey show was really good."
1939,2017-7,We purchased our tickets at the airport and it is much cheaper than online or direct. Don't forget to buy meal tickets as well because the food inside Disneyland is a bit pricey. Aside from the rides we got a bit gaga over original items that you can find in their stores and mind you there are plenty of stores scattered around the park! You should try the Grizzly ride and it's not for the faint at heart. Same with the mountain space ride. The new Toy story attraction is worth the longline and will definitely go back. Make sure to witness both the afternoon and evening parade of the charcters and the finale which is the fireworks display. It was exhausting and one day is not enough! You can plan a two day stay to really get to know the place.
1940,2017-7,"something really different. The park was decorated with Halloween theme. When night comes, they are staffs in Halloween themed outfit. Thats the only time you get to snap pictures of pumpkins in disneyland."
1941,2017-7,"Earlier I thought of giving 5 stars, but I am reducing it to 4 stars after visiting OceanPark. The latter is having more number of thrilling rides than this Disneyland. Overall, you can enjoy and feel better in Disneyland if you are accompanied with your child. The afternoon and evening parade are must to watch.Make sure that you check the park map online and make a rough plan as per your interest of rides so that you can cover them up early in the morning without any rush. Shows     (check latest shows and timings in the website)The Festival of Lion King   must watch show. Timings   12:00 PM, 2:00 PM, 4:30 PM, 6:00 PM     Adventureland     30mins show.Mickey and the Wondrous Book   12:00 PM, 1:15 PM, 3:45 PM, 5:15 PM, 6:30 PM     Fantasyland     28mins showOnly light snacks     such as crackers and cookies, and water, juice are allowed in Disneyland.Ticket booking options: 1. Direct on the spot but depends on the availability. 2. Get online ticket from direct website 3. Get online voucher ticket from Klook (Singapore based website), KKday (Taiwan based website), Yatra (India based website) Timings: 10.30am to 8.45pm"
1942,2017-7,"As an avid Disneyland fan, despite of this Disneyland is smaller than the others it is still a very fun place to go. The only lacking point is the rides are just too kiddy. I spend the whole day in this place making sure I visit every spot and watched every parade. Lovely times!"
1943,2017-7,"Friends advised that this is a great park to visit with young children. We took our daughter for her eighth birthday and it certainly didn't disappoint.Having done a lot of research we spread our visit over a day and a half in the middle of the week. This was perfect. There was barely a queue for any ride we wanted to go on. The day and a half meant we didn't have to rush on anything and gave us time to queue to see Mickey and Minnie and revisit our favourite rides. We used the spare half day to get our daughter a princess make over at the Bibbidi Bobbidi boutique and go for a character dinner at the Enchanted garden in the Disneyland hotel.This is a park suited to younger children. A few of the rides are quite young i.e. the teacups. That said, there is the ubiquitous space mountain, the brilliant run away mine cars (our favourite) and several others to keep the wider family amused. There are  characters  all over the park, ranging from the traditional characters and princesses right through to storm troopers and Stitch (from Lilo and Stitch). My biggest tip is to walk right on past the first mickey and minnie you will see just inside the park. We did queue for these on the second morning and waited an hour and half! We didn't mind as we had already done most of the park on the first day so had the time. Walk on by and you will no doubt see more Mickey and Minnies in other parts of the park with no queues.The park has the usual Disney day time and evening parades with the fireworks. These are not on the scale you might see in WDW in Florida. As an example we saw 3 floats in the day time parade. Together with the dancers it had passed us within about 10 minutes. But you won't fight for a spot to see it and the kids are still blown away by the whole thing. The night time fireworks were really brilliant.A particular tip is to make time to see the Lion King performance. It was absolutely outstanding and really worth doing. This alone is a good reason to do more than one day at the park as the timing of the performances can get tight with also seeing things like the day time parade. We did find eating here a little bit of a challenge. There are lots of places selling high sugar or on the go snacks, but not many options to eat properly. This can be a bit of a challenge if you're staying for the whole day (the park closes at 8), and have hungry kids. We went to the main street corner cafe which was ok but nothing great.It's worth being aware of the location. If you don't know, HK is on several islands and so it can take a bit of time to get out to Disney. There are public transport options but if you're just visiting HK and really want to do the whole park I would recommend staying at the resort (there are two hotels) as it does give you more flexibility. We mixed a stay at first in the city with two nights at Disney and this worked well.The staff are the usual friendly Disney crew. Lots of smiles, and stickers for the kids. Basically this place has all the right Disney magic without the crowds! A winner for me."
1944,2017-7,There are many theme lands in HK Disneyland and none of them fail to amaze you. The connecting metro is also styled in Disney fashion. It was just amazing experience
1945,2017-7,"It is a place to be seen, beautiful and congested.Modern yet old, expensive but cheap on some levels.Transportation from the airport is as expected expensive as any big city. We use uber to get around and it was the most cost effective.Mass transit also works well and is reasonable to use.We did the combination of the two.Victoria peak is a.must see at sundown and evening. HK is stunning from there. Hotels are not cheap and rooms are very small by our standards.Food was surprisingly expensive in large restaurants but there are always fast food options!HK is a must see place if only once in your life."
1946,2017-7,Hong Kong is the very first outside country a traveled and it we were so exciting to go there. We spent our first day at the Hong Kong Disneyland and it was tiring yet fun. I love the ambiance as well as their one time entrance fee which you can ride unlimited. Had out lunch inside costing 220 300HKD. I love also the time during afternoon parade it was so looong and full of excitement. I saw many Filipinos their like me. It like im not outside the country .
1947,2017-7,"I have been to other Disneylands many times. The Hong Kong Disneyland is very well done as Disney always is. It Is a smaller park with many very good live shows. There are not many big rides such as rollercoasters and fast rides. But overall the park was lovely. My grandson had a great time in Fantasyland, the buzz ride, Toy Story land etc. I would definitely return with small children."
1948,2017-7,"If you're into standing in long lines to get your picture taken with Disney characters, then this is a place for you! The lineups are long for the rides, which pale in comparison to California Disneyland. If you want great rides, I'd suggest going to Ocean Park, instead of HK Disneyland. If you want a shirt that says  I went to HK Disneyland , then this is your place."
1949,2017-7,One of the famous activities in Hong Kong. Hong Kong Disneyland was small place that you can walk around easily but full of the attractions. Its very suitable for kids.
1950,2017-7,"Whatever age you are, you will always love Disneyland! Two special times you should go, Christmas or Halloween and our schedule permitted us to go during Halloween! Loved what they did to the place. The decoration, shows, highlights and all! Although the food can be pricey, you and your family will love to see Mickey mouse and the whole gang. Plan your visit here in order to skip attractions or rides that are not suitable for you. The park opens at 10am so better be there early in order to make your trip worthwhile."
1951,2017-7,We took two day ticket from klook   and let me tell you it's never enough.. We went during Halloween   time so everything was decked up Halloween style Day 1 was a bit hectic with the late check in and long flight yet we managed to squeeze in few attraction leaving plays and parade for the next day. All the attractions were so much fun the kids loved it and then coming to parades disneyland night time   Halloween theme villan nights out   parade was simply magical!   We managed to catch up with festival of the lion king show which was   spectacular. We were not so lucky with meet and greet disney characters.. We did manage to get few snaps of various disney   characters   but missed quite a few tooo... The disneyland park did serve halal food so dining was pleasant experience. We booked our ticket through klook which included a voucher food voucher   so incase you are looking for halal restaurant you can visit Hk disneyland website for further detail on designated halal eatery anyway we ended our disney journey with a magical extravagant show of fireworks its was a perfect end to our magical journey Overall.. DISNEYLAND lived up to its tag line **where dream comes true *happiest place on earth**
1952,2017-7,Fun attractions and for the young at heart. Mickey mouse train theme was a nice touch. Special train station for Disneyland goers
1953,2017-7,One of the best attractions in hong kong. Best ride is the mystic manor so make sure you don't miss it. Loved the lion king show. Food is expensive so it is better to bring packed food with you. Both the parades were great and the fireworks display was splendid. Must see in hong kong.
1954,2017-7,"As a long time lover of Disney, I knew I had to visit Disneyland when I started planning my trip to Hong Kong. I've only been to the two in the US, so this was a very different experience but definitely one that I would highly recommend for anyone who enjoys exploring Disney parks. I thought the admission price was reasonable despite the park being so small, at least compared to the prices in the US. My husband and I visited on a Tuesday and the park was completely empty, we didn't wait more than 5 minutes for any ride and on most of them we walked right on without a wait at all. That being said, I really wanted a picture with Mickey and Minnie (they were dressed for Halloween!) but the line was gigantic so I skipped it, it was the only place a ton of people seemed to be congregating. We arrived right as the park opened and a number of the rides and sections of the park were still closed off for another half hour or so which I thought was odd, but we took that time to walk around and figure out where everything was. Since we got through the rides we wanted to do so quickly we only stayed for about a half a day but that was perfect for us. I was sad to see that the facade of It's A Small World was under construction so it was covered in tarps, but at the same time I realize that Disney is always updating and freshening the rides up, so it is usually to be expected. The real struggle we faced was that the rides seemed to be built for smaller passengers, my husband is 6'4  and was barely squeezing into some of the cars, the most difficult ride of all was Space Mountain. They put him in, what they said, the seat with the most leg room and we still almost had to give up and get off because he couldn't squeeze his knees in. He did end up wiggling in at the last second but was extremely uncomfortable and had a scraped knee by the time we got off. Other than that detail, the rides were great! We especially enjoyed the ones that are exclusive to HK, such as Grizzly Gulch and Mystic Manor (this is almost the equivalent of the Haunted Mansion). Since we visited during Halloween time there was a haunted house type of attraction but we were a little puzzled as to what was going on. There were live actors but no one was speaking English so we were just sort of following the crowd and trying to figure out the story line.. everyone who understood the actors seemed to be really scared though! All in all it was a great experience, definitely a must do for the Disney lovers out there. If you can, try to go early to mid week and get there for the park opening, you'll easily have a good view of the ribbon cutting which is fun to watch and it gets a little more crowded as the day goes on."
1955,2017-8,For me it is the highlight of Hong Kong!! Nice place to be! staff or the dancers you will never see them not smiling! they are happy as you are you can fell that they also love their job!. how I wish I can stay in this place forever!.Lion king Team is the BESSSST!! kudos to the team
1956,2017-8,this is a must see attraction. Mind blowing even if you are not taking kids.  Do not  miss the fireworks which happen post 6 pm that is the best part of the tour.
1957,2017-8,"If you are a Disney person, write this place as  1 must seen in your travel itinerary and don't leave this magical place before you see the spectacular firework.. will come back for sure with my future kiddo     "
1958,2017-8,"Disneyland was great the magic is truely there when you walk in, we stayed at the hotel as well which made it even more magical, we didn't have to queue much for anything like rides or even to get in, the staff were friendly, the food fantastic, I recommend two days so the first day you don't take any photos and the second you do, just to give to chance to really explore what it has to offer, a good range of rides for all ages:) "
1959,2017-8,Like all Disney lands great fun for every age. There is a good discount if you are a pensioner.   Go to your favoutite rides first to avoid the queues. Good parking and directions.
1960,2017-8,"Disneyland was the main reason for our hong kong tour. We had a fun time. It was weird hearing the characters speak in Chinese but you will eventually get use to it. I love the star wars area :)It's great place for pictures. But please take note they strictly prohibit the use of selfie stick. This is my dream place for a pre wedding pictorial.One day is not enough to enjoy the place. No long lines, only 5minute wait with all the rides and attraction. Explore first! Don't shop at the first two hours of your stay in Disneyland.It is expensive, we expected that so we wanted good service. Maybe it's the culture thing but the staff could be more polite. It looked like it hurts when they smile. It's better to download the app before visiting the place than go find help in the information area. People there were useless and rude.Bring a big bottle of water, because it is expensive!"
1961,2017-8,"We've been here a number of times (no kids, just big kids) and this is the smallest Disney park we've been to but it's still fun. Even when it's reasonably busy you can get round the whole park in a day, including the parade and the fireworks display at the end. The park is easy to get to by MTR and has its own dedicated line for the last bit, you can even buy your tickets at the MTR station before setting out and beat some of the queues! It's not cheap but then Disney theme parks never are."
1962,2017-8,"This is a must see attraction for anyone visiting Hong Kong with children. Plenty of fun things for kids to see and do, lots of photo opportunities with your favourite Disney characters and the parades down Main Street are brilliant. There are too many great things to say about Disneyland, you must make time to visit. "
1963,2017-8,I took Disneyland Themed train from Sunny bay MTR and reached Disneyland station.. its very easy and comfortable fast ...although i dint visit inside i just walked up to the entrance and took some snaps around..as i was not much interested since i ve visited Universal studios in Singapore earlier.. The ticket is bit expensive and kids & adults can really enjoy it i hope.. 
1964,2017-8,Catching the Disney train was great the way that it's decked out is amazing Arriving early we waited and got to look around the main entrance was so clean tide and wow just beautiful Upon entry was reared by lots of Halloween things as it was only a week away was surprised that the Asians had got into it so muchWas a hot day but there was a typhoon warning out so set about seeing as much as we could was just amazing but disappointed as there was lots of rides not open because of the warning but wasn't windy or rainingHad a awesome lunch in the Chinese restaurant went with the set menu wow just so good worth doing for sure better than take out foodSo much to see and do in only one day and just as we was leaving it stared to shower so it was the start of the typhoon A awesome day
1965,2017-8,"My son love this place so much.. he is first coaster ride is Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars, and he love it.. and another cool ride is space mountain.. will comeback here again soon."
1966,2017-8,Ever green disney park is really a fun for small young kids with fun and fantasy and music and all character of cartoon and virtual world. Park looks more attractive in Christmas days with more musical parade of Disney character. Whole day fun in romantic p k ave
1967,2017-8,"I've enjoyed the shops, shows and the place, however there's no many activities and games for adults"
1968,2017-8,"It was my first time out of the country and went to Hongkong. Of course, Disneyland was one of the places to go. I felt like a kid again! The shows were superb and awesome! The rides were exhilarating! Wasn't able to witness the parade of Disney princesses though :( But stayed til the end for the fireworks and it was magical! So worth it! "
1969,2017-8,"Very easy to get to using public transport. We went there on a Monday, Halloween and thought that it would be very busy. However it wasn't too bad. Getting there was super easy, just a couple of train rides and you're at Disneyland Station. We got there a little after 12pm and still had plenty of time to do all the things we wanted to do.The lines were pretty quick, the longest time we waited was about 30min for Mystic Manor as they had technical issues for most of the day, so when it did re open everyone wanted to go on it. But it was worth the wait, different from the other rides I've been on. Download the app as it will shows you with the wait times for the lines and help you plan your day better. Even though we got there a little later in the day, we were able to go on all the rides we wanted to, got to watch the shows and parades and had a very leisurely day. No running around trying to fit it all in, so going on a weekday was a great idea. We stuck around until the fireworks, which were amazing!The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the cost of the food! Very expensive, but then again most attractions are."
1970,2017-8,You can sense the disney magic but if you've every been to other Disney Parks this is just a little guy.... limited number rides.  Not a multi day experience.  Glad I went... won't do it again.
1971,2017-8,"Kids have a blast at disneyland.  Very well organised at all counters and all stalls.  The only minus is if you are a vegetarian, there is hardly anything you can eat. The veg pizza tastes bad."
1972,2017-8,"We came to celebrate Halloween,we saw many kinds of different decorations.All places here full of Halloween atmosphere!We spent a lot of time here from 10:00 23:00 and watched all parades.Main street has many stores,we bought ears and souvenirs,and I bought my new friend Gelatoni ! But there are too much The Duffys there,less Winnie the Pooh or other classic figures."
1973,2017-8,The theme park is very nice all of the Disney characters are there. More over the place is clean and the park attendants are nice and friendly.
1974,2017-8,"We went on Halloween weekend and saw the villain parades and the experiment ghost house (not in English but still fun). The park was quiet enough, especially in the morning, to go on the rides without queuing for longer than about 5 10 minutes, some had no queues at all."
1975,2017-8,Twas a great trip with nieces and 3 nephews .   Hongkong disneyland was enjoyable due to the Halloween atmosphere.    So much fun. The weather was good and not too sunny.
1976,2017-9,"This is my second time to Hong Kong Disneyland, although my visits have been about 10 years apart. My feeling about the park remains the same.You have to feel a bit bad for HKDL. It was, basically, built on the cheap with the expectation that people would come no matter what. And they didn't. Significant investment has been made but the fact remains that this is the only park around the world that doesn't have much going for it.While the place has changed much for the better since I went just after it opened, it's still a pretty small place. One day is more than enough time to explore this park   in fact, you may find yourself bored by the end of the day. The day we visited was incredibly quiet and we did almost everything in the park in about 6 hours. They have some new unique rides that are fun, but sadly most of the parks original rides are clones from other parks around the world making it the most bland Disney park on earth.Nevertheless, I still give it 4 stars. Cast members are happy and friendly, the place still has the Disney touch and it operates well as a whole. It's just never going to be Orlando, or Tokyo or even Shangai   it's brand new competitor due north. At the end of the day, however, Hong Kong Disneyland still offers some magic to everyone."
1977,2017-9,Once you enter Disneyland each step is magical! You don't know where to look and where to go. You want to do everything. Best time to reach is by 10am as there are shorter queues for all rides and one can actually do more rides if you reach early. By noon its crowded and that means longer queue. If you are a fan I would think you will go mad :) but stay sane. There is food for everyone. The restaurants serve food from the globe even tandoori chicken . If you have a baby or small kid you can go to the office and hire a stroller. Kids will love it that way. It can be a bit hot so please take your shade and hats caps. If you have luggage and heading to airport post the visit you can store it at the office for 90hkd. Don't miss the Toy Story Land. Have fun!!!
1978,2017-9,We just love Disneyland. Mickey & friends with costumes were very very cute       We'd love to come back    
1979,2017-9,This would be a great disney experience for families with small children as there are lots of character photo ops and park is fairly compact.After visiting Disneyworld and Disneyland this was a bit of a let down. Very quiet and lacks the atmosphere of its American parks.Shopping is very limited and repetitive in every shop.
1980,2017-9,"THE reason we visited Hong Kong and we were so glad to do so. Compared to the Flordia, California and even Tokyo DL this one is smaller but nevertheless the fun was unlimited. The property was very well maintained, directions were as usual pretty good. One weird thing was some shows were in Chinese which we found funny (no pun intended) as we were alien to the language and more than that the lines were coming out from Mickey and company. The Halloween parade was awesome and so were the Halloween themed fireworks (we went in October). We had a great time and will not loose an opportunity of visiting again. And best part was the connectivity to MTR   great planning!"
1981,2017-9,Venue was easily accessible using the train system and travelling on the Disney train with Mickey Mouse shaped windows is great fun for all ages. A dozen or more rides are available covering all age groups and an amazing street parade with firework display occurs around 7.30pm each night. We (2 adults) spent a whole day there and had a ball. Great Disney merchandise available
1982,2017-9,"Again I would say no need to do advance booking while you start travel from India... You get enough tickets available in online portals there with discounts... Evening light show is a must and is amazingly beautiful.... try jungle safari with kids , they will definitely enjoy... Personal advice  don't buy anything from here... its too costly.. same stuff available at airport and other places in the city and a much discounted rate... I purchased t shirts for my kid but not worth the money... If you have visited Universal studio you might not find visiting this place worth the money and effort... restaurants inside are very very costly.. try bakeries instead..."
1983,2017-9,"Good connection by MTR.We visit there in quiyet time, still kids need standing and wait if they want go in same photo in figures.Food was fast food, ticket Prices is too high, because its disneyland, and there is not special...One time to see..."
1984,2017-9,"Disneyland is very awesome! It made me felt like a kid again. The rides, the mascots the shops everything is perfect. This Disneyland is a must to visit in Hongkong."
1985,2017-9,"It was a wonderful experience. So much fun for my 5 years old.  But for adults and those who seek for adrenaline rush, better opt for ocean park."
1986,2017-9,"A bit ordinary, not up to other Disneylands, OK for younger children. Pick a cool day, the weather can be quite oppresive given it is a long day probably with kids."
1987,2017-9,"We were fortunate to have been there on Halloween. They had Villains' Night Out which was delightfully entertaining. They also had Mickey's Halloween Parade. That time they were featuring Star Wars & Chewbacca was adorable! Very warm & friendly & game. They also had a new ride, Grizzly Gulch, which we enjoyed tremendously. Another memorable Disneyland experience. Thank you, HKDL!"
1988,2017-9,Been here twice with toddlers and my kids love it!It's a nice small park and never a long wait for rides.You could easily do it in one day unless you want to see all the shows. But we just wanted to go on the rides and see some characters. We spent 2 days here each time and it was fantastic. Older kids might find it boring however it's just the right size for the smaller ones before they get too tired. Staff give out huge amounts of stickers to the kids too! I also like how they take photos for you on your phone so your not expected to buy the professional ones. Great day out! 
1989,2017-9,"This was my first time going to HK Disneyland and my first time going to any Disney park as an adult, but it made no difference because it was Disney!We came on a Tuesday, the day after a long weekend, and it was wonderful. Busy enough that we didn't want to line up to take photos with the characters, but quiet enough that we only needed to line up at most for 5 minutes for a ride. Some rides we went on more than once just because we could and the lack of line ups made it worth the time.The prices in the shops were what you expected   expensive. The food was surprisingly good. Expensive as any food would be in a theme park, but it wasn't bland like I expected. My husband who went nearly ten years ago (as a young adult, ha) was not as impressed. He enjoyed it very much still, but did comment on how the staff did not look as happy and energetic (by Disney standards) and that it looked a bit rundown, compared to before and what you would expect from the Disney business. For examples, paint was chipping off on a few of the rides and the mannequins in the shops were not in good condition (one had all but his middle finger broken off). For the price you pay, you would expect more in its maintenance. We went on must of the rides and spent a good amount of time in the shops, and were walking out just after 4 hours. We may consider coming back when we have kids, but would be willing to splurge a little more for another Disney location if the upkeep is better there."
1990,2017-9,"We have been to all the Disney resorts. This one is by far the smallest. It is still lovely and the big perk is that there are NO LINES. You can easily do this park in a half day with Big Buddha. the cost is less than the other parks too, so half day is still a value. Or for very little more you can do a second day before you get on your flight."
1991,2017-9,"A review from a 7 and 10 year old. Go when there is a typhoon, because there is no queuing! We even got to meet Micky and Minnie Mouse.The Lion King Show was extraordinary.4D cinema was even better than we were expecting.Micky and the wondrous book was wonderful.3 words IT WAS AWESOME!Fireworks great   can see them from everywhere.Starwars rides was so good   all of us enjoyed this."
1992,2017-9,"Hong Kong Disneyland unleashed the inner child in me. I found myself sitting on the carousell,battling space monsters,watching shows,singing along to the 'it's a small world' song. I loved the Halloween decorations and theme. The fireworks were wonderful! Still in a Disney mode even after my holiday has ended "
1993,2017-9,"It's nice to be back after 10 years! Hong Kong Disney have always surprise us! The park has expanded with Toy Story Land, Mystic and more to come. Can't wait for our next visit!"
1994,2017-9,"Visited for the third time, this time with cousins and their children. We were a group of 14 and had a blast. Not our first time but it was for our joining family members. Our kids had a great time because this time they had their cousins with them. Loved the free stickers given by the Disney staff. "
1995,2017-9,The grandest theme park we ever visited in our lifetime. The rides were breathtaking and the cartoon characters were cooperative enough for family photos. Great location near the hills!
1996,2017-10,"Disneyland is famous for their theme park, so when we're in hong kong, we reserve one day to spend time there.Going there is easy, we took mtr and the last station and train is so cute, the window's train's shape like head of mickey mouse and inside it, you can see some showcase of some disney character. The station is also different from other mtr station.You can buy ticket online and sometimes there's some promotion buying online. I got the tickets with the same price as if you buy in front of the park and with food package that can be use for lunch or dinner that worth 185hkd. Don't forget bring the confirmation and credit card you use to buy online. Behind the ticket booth there's some ticket machine to get the tickets and food vouchers.Tips :  go there on weekdays  check the weather on the chosen day  take the map of the park (located near the toilet after the entrance gate)  there are several drinking water tap in the park, don't forget to bring the bottle  fast pass is available in some games (information in the map), take the one that interest you, so you can save time  restaurant are spread in all over the park and food & drink stall too  parade and firework are show in the evening so finish playing before the parade  souvenir shop also spread all over the park and the biggest one is in the main road before the entrance (from inside)"
1997,2017-10,"Was in hongkong for 3 nights on my business conference. Got lucky enough to visit disneyland. Went there early morning around 10 am along with our group. We spent the whole day coz fireworks ceremony starts @ 8pm daily without seeing a fireworks it was not worth it. Roller coaster, 4D movie, lionking story, food , even for Muslim tourist halal restaurants was there. Shops were selling all disney products. 10  10 for hongkong disneyland. Halowen day on 31st October was amazing. "
1998,2017-10,"I visited Hong Kong Disneyland one day before typhoon Haima and park was really quiet and weather was really hot, I actually heard at Disneyland by email that my flight was cancelled back home and I needed to contact my airline back in Finland. I went to City Hall Guest service and they let me call from Hong Kong back to Finland for free! Thank you so much for that! It was so helpful and kind, cause I was travelling solo and couldn't contact Finnair online, which was really annoying. There were no lines on that day which was really great, but a bit sad was that not all the restaurant were open and they even opened land one by one. So after park opened you still needed to wait until they open all lands.I loved the shows especially Mickey and the Wondrous Book and I loved it that they actually sang by themselves! And the Festival of Lion King too.Halloween parades were quiet short if you compare to other parades, which was a little minus and also even if staff at Guest Service were really helpful and didn't find customer service overall at the Park as good as at Shanghai Disneyland. Cast Members were not smiling or welcoming you almost at all.Still thank you for this magical day!"
1999,2017-10,"Was pleasantly surprised by the ease of getting from the city to disneyland by the MTR. there is even a dedicated train to disneyland   super cool! on the day we went, the weather was really nice. there was not a big a crowd as i had expected. we did not have to wait long for the rides. the attractions are fun, enjoyable and entertaining. the park is very well maintained. there are many water fountains, rest rooms, resting areas around. all the staff are very helpful and friendly. the night ended with a show which was great. we enjoyed the day immensely! it is definitely a must visit place. "
2000,2017-10,"Mostly standard fare Disneyland rides, but the Haunted House backstory and ride is different than at any other Disney park.  The rest of the park is fun and clean.  Subway access makes it very easy to get to and from."
2001,2017-10,"I went to Disneyland HongKong on 26th October 2016. I got the HongKong Station MTR to Sunny Bay then changed the MTR to Disneyland Resort Station. It was nice weather and Disneyland decorated with Halloween theme. I like Mickeys Philharmagic show. I enjoyed Mickey Halloween parade. But unfortunately I couldn't take a photo with Mickey and Minnie Mouse because I was a solo traveller so I have no one to take a photo of me, maybe next time "
2002,2017-10,Suitable for ages 6 and below. Not  much for bigger kids and adults. Just 2 roller coasters. My youngest 4 year old enjoyed. The elder who is 10 was done within 4 hours
2003,2017-10,"Highly recommend going on a working weekday if possible and purchase your tickets ahead of time from klook.com for a slight discount and avoid the long line at the entrance. Some rides offer fast lanes so if it's a long wait you can get a queue and go to do other rides in the meantime. As an adult returning to Disneyland again in 30 years, still enjoyed the It's a Small World ride, the Jungle RIde, and especially the Mystic Mansion."
2004,2017-10,Spending 2 days in this park is truly the happiest and tiring in our 5 days HK trip. The kids are all smiling and enjoying all the time. Meeting characters are our favorite. every minute is worthwhile.
2005,2017-10,"Its a dream come true . If you can afford it do take the fast pass ,saves you precious time without waiting in the queue .  Also check out the days timings for various shows ...they are not to be missed ."
2006,2017-10,we have only been to 2 Disneyland parks being Paris and Hong Kong and found this one the best park so far people are more friendly and respecful than Paris
2007,2017-10,"it was endeed a great vacation for me and my niece, our first day was well spent at Disneyland, fire works was amazing and we really had a lots of fun. next day was in Lantao island, we take the cable car and that was fantastic experience. i would definitely love to do it again if i have another chance, the Big buddha was also interesting and i love the old and quality architecture inside. over all, hong kong is a great country, mtr was the our means of transportaion and ended a great help for our travel. but to be honest i found their local people quite rude but ignore the people just enjoy the country and the good places."
2008,2017-10,"At the end of the day, this is a version of Disneyland. If you like Disney theme parks, you'll love it; if you don't, this park won't convert you to the wonders of Mickey. Be aware that this park is tiny compared to the US version (at 123 acres, this is the smallest of Disney   s theme parks), and most of the attractions are geared towards families with small children. On the positive side of things, however, the lines tend to be blissfully short, so if you can only spare four or five hours, the park is still worth visiting. Don't miss Mystic Manor (it's adorable!) or the Festival of the Lion King (a large scale production with giant animal puppets, acrobats, flame eaters and dancers; the dialogue is a mix of Cantonese and English, and the songs are performed in English)."
2009,2017-10,"As a big Disney fan I had to tick Disney Hong Kong off my list, having done Florida, California and Paris I kinda knew what to expect, but surprisingly some things were different which was good.Firstly the train to get you into the parks wowed me, all the windows are mickey mouse heads and the hand holders are shaped like Mickey mouse heads and along the carriages are figures of the characters. The park is on a much smaller scale to any of the others but that made it so easy to get around in such a short space of time, we arrived around 1030 and were finished by 2pm but waited until 3 for the Halloween parade. The rides which I have been on before in the other parks were slightly different which was really good as you don't know whats coming. The day we went queues were not long at all on average 15 min waits. It was the Halloween festival while we were there so lots of things going on, there were people dressed up giving out free candy.The parade was a Halloween themed one which was really good. They had plenty of shops and restaurants around the park and the food was not badly priced considering its Disney."
2010,2017-10,"Perfect for a one day trip and for young children as you don't need to walk that much. The main Disney attractions are there.I went on a Friday and arrived early but most attractions opened at 11am.It surprised me that within the park they don't take credit card payments, just cash!!! I would not have expected that from Disney.Go on weekdays!!"
2011,2017-10,"1) Really enjoyed the shows   Lion King, Mickey & the marvellous book. 2) A picture with characters like Princess Sofia, Elsa, Belle not very easy   queues are long but worthwhile offcourse for your little one3) Plan the trip in advance   read about the show timings on the website"
2012,2017-10,"We went during the week not in school holidays and it was great. Didnt have to wait for anything just walked straight on and even rode a few things twice. Space Mountain is brilliant, better than the Florida one and the mining train ride is great too. Not many big rides and no water ride which is surprising considering how hot it is. Food is average but you don't go there for its culinary delights. "
2013,2017-10,My mistake. I went with big hope of having high thrill rides with big drops and upside down rides. To my surprise it was mainly for small children only and a couple of rides for parents to keep them un bored. Restaurant options are very limited i would say with the scale of name this place has achieved. Overall the theme is catered to shell out as much money from parents as possible to please their children by selling products Mickey branded. 
2014,2017-10,"We visited Disney for the second time and again no queues!. While it doesn't have all the big rides associated with Florida and the USA in general, there was plenty to do and it is still full of Disney Magic. I particularly like that they do a reduced price for seniors. Great idea"
2015,2017-10,"I have been to Disney World Florida almost 25 times over the years and Disneyland California about three and Disneyland Hong Kong 4.By Far Florida is the best and biggest but Hong Kong it pretty nice too. The rides and attractions are smaller in scale and the Cinderella's Castle is much smaller but for Hong Kong and Visitors that have only to have Hong Kong as their Disney Experience it delivers a huge experience and one that kids will surely enjoy.Hong Kong Disney is growing in size adding new sections and drawing larger crowds and from mainland china and beyond. If you are a tourist or a resident in Hong Kong I would hope you would take your children and or like me take you spouse or girlfriend and have a great full day of fun.The nice thing about Hong Kong Disney is the size, its a full day adventure and very manageable unlike Florida as it really is a 6 day event to do it right.Dont forget to stay for the parade ad mid day and at night. Its worth it and dont forget your cameras."
2016,2017-11,"This is a small and compact theme park, a day is enough, but it is very nice and there are some good rides and some good attractions to see we enjoyed ourselves. The dining experience is obviously captive and as such it never fails to disappoint. The Corner Cafe on Main Street was where we had lunch and quite frankly it is some of the worst service and the worst food I have ever seen in my life. Drinks never arrived, we were a party of four who all dined separately because the meals came at totally different times and the second round of drinks had to be chased four times. Just terrible. But the theme park itself is okay with the usual Disney merchandising one comes to expect. Worth a visit."
2017,2017-11,This is exciting and awesome. Requires atleast 2 days to fully enjoy all the attractions. Better to plan in advance on what to cover to enjoy maximum rides. Indian food is available only in 1 restaurant during our visit.
2018,2017-11,We came here as a group of adults but as soon as we stepped through the gates we were big kids again! It was very hot on the day we went but the landscaping around the park as well as buildings provided lots of shade and well needed air conditioned stops. We arrive in early morning and the queues were very short as a result. Staff were friendly and keen to know how we were enjoying our visit. The queues to have pictures taken with characters were probably the longest but staff were great at making sure people were being fair with photos and the characters themselves were brilliant. Our favourite rides were probably the run away mine cars and the Star Wars ride. Toy Story Land was the best for photo opportunities. My one recommendation for people visiting would to be to bring your own food and drink as it is expensive here. You'll need the money you save to spend on souvenirs!
2019,2017-11,Visited hong kong disneyland caught the mtr system loved the train with mickey mouse ear windows.As expected very clean easy access to rides ques not too long. Plenty of food choices. A fun day had by us big kids. Theme in the park is halloween at the moment so plenty of pumpkins about.
2020,2017-11,"We arrived just before10am. Once the gates opened I suggest you walk in and straight up into the Main Street area then you will find characters that you can get photos with.. Minnie and Mickey had a bit of a line but there was probably 3 others with hardly anyone there.. They just take photos with your camera.. Shortest lines for photos I seen all dayWe then tried not to be distracted by the shops and go on the rides.. we were able to do most the rides in the morning with less than 10min wait times..I couldn't believe by mid   late afternoon busloads of people arriving. It seems lots of people don't do start to finish time and come laterWe had lunch in a food court type restaurant, It cost nearly $30aud for a burger chips meal I was horrified, I found a cheaper place for dinnerThe Halloween parade went for maybe 10minutes so make sure you see the main parade..The fireworks were amazing, much more than just fireworks, it's a show of lights music etcI have been to the California Disneyland, I was still really happy with HK Disney, it's still magical and perfect just smaller..It was a massive day but worth it..Buy your tickets in Klook, heaps cheaper and the line is shorter . They just scan the paper and your inThere are no scary rides here but that suits it.. I just love the Disneyland experience "
2021,2017-11,This disneyland is very small compare to the one in paris or Usa but it was still a very nice experience. A perfect place to go with the kids.
2022,2017-11,"Hongkong Disneyland is relatively small comparing to other Disneylands. I consider it large enough for little kids like 3 7 years old. I also recommend weekday since it is not crowded at all. The queue to highly favorite attraction such as Pooh bear is only 15 minutes, use fastpass for 5 minutes only. :) Happy Disneyland trip with so many rides in a day."
2023,2017-11,"I met with my friend in there . Did not have high expectations since i read some bad comments about it. Once i got there, i was impressed.First of all, the whole place is organised and clean. There are maps to illustrate the routes to all attractions .The shows and attractions and rides overall were good and joyable and suitable for all ages (even adults )The ticket is a bit expensive but the whole journey is worth every penny you spendOverall, it was a good experience and you would need a whole day to complete the whole world of disney!! So get your legs stritched before you come, show up early and enjoy your time !! :) "
2024,2017-11,We are very well travelled Disney goers and would say this park is definitely targeted at younger families. Whilst Main Street and the lands much the same this park misses the rides for the big kids in us all. But We ticked the box.
2025,2017-11,"Being from California, I'm used to the huge lines at Anaheim Disneyland. So I was very surprised to walk right up to the boats of It's a small world, without even standing in line. (On a Saturday) This goes for all the other rides also. Luckily we rode all the rides before 2 pm. At 2 pm, mobs and mobs of people came streaming in. Not sure if there was a special event? But from that point on, lines were 40 min or longer. Also, it was fun collecting stickers from the Disney employees. (That's something they don't do at Anaheim.) It is smaller than Anaheim, but being able to NOT wait in line before 2 pm made the whole experience worth it. And it was so easy to get there via MTR. Also, we were able to get on the first MTR train we walked up to after exiting the park, after the fireworks. They must be very efficient. WIth so many people exiting, I was expecting a long wait for a train. Also bring mosquito repellent. I was bitten a lot within 15 min. of entering the park, and I noticed I wasn't the only one. There was also a sign at the entrance offering free mosquito spray at the first aid office."
2026,2017-11,"I have been to a lot of Disney properties throughout the world. Hong Kong Disneyland stood out due to it's lack of crowds and lines for rides. There may not be a ton of E ticket rides and certain Disney traits you might be used to are not present, but I never stood on a line longer than 10 minutes for a ride. Meeting characters on the other hand is a madhouse. The best advice is to arrive early and you can finish the park in a matter of hours."
2027,2017-11,"We visited the Hong Kong Disneyland on a Sunday and the longest time we had to line up was 25 minutes for two rides. Everything else was  walk straight in . Although the castle and many rides are smaller than in Tokyo Disneyland, we enjoyed this place as there were no huge crowds and we could easily ride all the rides we were interested in. Our favorites were the roller coasters  Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars  (starts off slowly, then goes backwards and finally speeds up a lot) and  Hyperspace Mountain  (a Star Wars themed in the dark ride).No real thrill rides here, after all it's Disneyland. Food and admission are very expensive but everything, from the rides to the staff, is very professional and well maintained. Also getting to the park is super easy, just take the Disneyland Resort line from Sunny Bay."
2028,2017-11,I enjoyed my visit to HK Disney. I know it's the smallest out of all the Disney theme parks but I think it's still worth a visit. HK has really gotten into the Disney experience because it's easy to find going on the mtr. Even got a Disney shuttle that gets the kiddie side of you excited as you approach the park.I've only been to the parks in the US and HK has a few things that the US didn't have. I especially liked Mystic Mansion. Also if you chose to go I suggest buying the tickets off of Klook. Saves me $5 and the food voucher.
2029,2017-11,"Went today with our 6 and 8 year olds. We got there about 2.30 and stayed until the fireworks finished. Lines were not huge. Occasionally we had to wait up to about 15 20 minutes for a ride and other times we got straight on. It was just luck of the timing. We went on the runaway mine cars about 6 times. We went on hyperspace mountain about 5 times. Towards the end of the day was best for short queues. Astroblasters was fun and Mystic manor was awesome for special effects. We hardly had time to eat, wasn't cheap. If you are not too fussed about getting close to sleeping beauty castle for the fireworks, I would stand at the top of the train station. Great view and near the exit for a quick getaway once finished. Not a huge park, but we really enjoyed it!I would suggest ideal ages are 5 12. Ocean park has more thrills for older kids."
2030,2017-11,"I have visited California Disney 2 times before in 2007 and 2010. This was our 3rd time to visit Disneyland but first time to go to Disney outside the USA. For the first time also I was taking my 6 year old daughter to a Disney park. She is a big fan of Elsa and Anna just like many girls :), and loves all Disney characters, knows their stories etc. Ok, Let me share some of my disappointments first   1. One thing we found missing was the courtesy in the staff at Disneyland HK towards visitors. There were less of helpers and more of process follower or policing staff in Disney land and this was something I have not observed in Disneyland resort earlier. Smiling and greeting attitude was missing in staff. It may be an ethnic or regional thing, as Chinese people seemed to be a bit rude in general (personal feeling, not to generalize).2. My daughter wanted to meet her favorite Disney characters but unfortunately she could not do. It was too much of time standing in the queues in the efforts to get a picture with them, but they do not even stop to allow taking a picture with them unlike in California. After standing in a queue for 2 hrs we could not meet Mickey and Minnie. I and my daughter just stepped out of Queue to get some food as she was hungry, but my wife was keeping our place in the queue, but when her turn came quicker than we thought and we got late to return just for 2 mins. we missed them once again :(. They could not wait on my wife's request as they said it was closing time for them (it was 6pm whereas park closes at 8pm). I immediately visited their guest services to request to allow just one picture with my daughter, but the reply I got was pretty cold  not possible sir .3. Overall the park is smaller in comparison with USA ones. but similarly ticket is also much lower than US; so it was NOT a disappointment. Now the good things  1. Ticket Price is very competitive. With the usual cost of everything in Hongkong, this is pretty decent price to spend a day with your family with experience of Disneyland.2. Travel easiness; with wonderful MTR network directly taking you to park, it is actually very convenient going to Disneyland from any part of the hongkong city."
2031,2017-11,I found this disneyland to be a little more neat than the others.Every ride every corner of it has been done so well.Awesome connectivity by train to the city as well.Super place to go with kids anytime of the year   .
2032,2017-11,"Strangely empty, a handful of rides and not the friendliest cast members made this a one and done Disney experience"
2033,2017-11,"We are annual pass holders at Disneyworld, so it was a no brainer to go. Most of the attractions are a little different and the have some new ones. Very well done and very Disney. The shows are all in Chinese so if you go, go for the visual. A half day was enough to cover the park for us. Do not change money there, terrible exchange rate. Getting there is easy and the Disney train is, well very Disney "
2034,2017-11,it is a magical place and truly fulfills the promise. One needs two days to do full justice to the park although it is a fairly smallish park.
2035,2017-11,"IMO very badBeen to japan one and hk seems to be very pale in comparisionKids always enjoy the parade but the parade at 3pm only feature1   mickey2   minnie3   goofyWhilst the park at tokyo feature the entire cast of the parksAlso due to low season, a lot of eateries not openWeather is hot to enjoy the ridesRecommend go in cooling season"
2036,2017-12,Alot of nice places but it was too crowded when I visit.  Alot of merchandise shops that are v good for getting gifts and stuffs.
2037,2017-12,"The park is very clean, beautiful and a MUST if in Hong Kong. Any Disney lover must visit. I will say for people seeking a thrill park (roller coasters, spooky rides etc) then you may be disappointed. It is a park which is highly suitable for kids and I couldn't think of one ride that a child wouldn't be able to partake in. The character meet and greets can be tricky if you don't plan accordingly   and they come out at the same times in different locations   which can mean choosing between some. It took us nearly 6 hours of lines   planning   chasing down characters to get meet and greets."
2038,2017-12,"Absolute waste of money spent aud182 for 2 adults soaked from pouring heavy rain with no rides or outdoor parades being operational.With a 2 year old in tow it was horrible. If parades and rides are cancelled how do you expect patrons to enjoy the full potential of a once in a life time family day out? Complained to manager who wouldn't even budge to give money back or discount. Spent $200 at the Disney store, had lunch and enough was enough so caught mtr back to hotel.So annoyed I could have saved $182 entry fee if I had known there was a Disney store in HKG airport."
2039,2017-12,"You need to check the weather before booking, I suggest that you stay near to the Tung Chung area outlet shopping center so you can enjoy the shopping and your kids and you have a good time in Disney land ( safe transportation money), try to go early as much as you can, bring some snacks with you, drink a plenty of water as you can it's hot in my time (oct). Have a good and funny time"
2040,2017-12,Very expensive but same pricing as the other Disneyland resorts. The other difference is that this one is quite small and we were done by 5pm on a week day. The queues were so short (5 to 10 minutes) we managed to go on a few rides at least 4 or 5 times. All in all the kids enjoyed it so that was the important part. Easy to get to via MTR as well.
2041,2017-12,"Been there a few days before. Was lucky to witness the Hallowe'en Fest! The Mickey parade and the Hallowe'en parade at night were just beyond my imagination. I had never ever imagined to see something so lovely. You can just sit and look at the beautiful environment. The rides were great. Lot of restaurants but a problem for my vegetarian friends.'its a small world', 'mystic manor', 'hyperspace station' , 'parachute drop' are few of the things u must cover while on your visit."
2042,2017-12,"Fantastic place   so clean and every detail is so exact; a real pleasure to visit. No long queues and all the rides were great fun.The catering is poor   many outlets were closed and the ones which were open were crowded and noisy; the quality of the food was terrible. We thought that they would confiscate food we tried to take in when they did the bag searches BUT other people were allowed in, so next time we will take our own food.This is a big place and I think it's better to buy the 3 day pass and at least do one morning afternoon visit and on another day do an afternoon and evening visit. We were so tired from walking and the activities that we had to miss the fireworks in the evening.A great day out and 100 times better than Ocean Park."
2043,2017-12,"Thanks to HK Disneyland.They have two certified Halal restaurants   The Explorers Club and Tahitian Terrace.One important thing for muslim, they prayer room already move from City Hall to room just next to restroom at The Explorer Club.They also have a stroller for hire.HKD100 HKD100(deposit).Thanks for the facilities!!!I dont want to mention about other thing because everything was perfect.We spend the whole day from morning until firework!!"
2044,2017-12,"My 3 yr old and 7 yr old girls loved it very bit. The idea was to let them see the characters and hopefully make them beleive in the fantasy they create. Disneyland does that & more .... in style.The evening fireworks was spectacularThe villains parade and Mickey Mouse parade funtastic.The rides were so cute that my younger one wanted to keep doing them. It was indeed magical for the kids and the glee on their faces was worth every minute  nickel spent. We took the 2 day pass, did the evening parade and fireworks on day 1 and spend the entire next day on the rides for children. None of the rides are scary. The slow ones are where the kids enjoy anyway....The boat ride was nice with a lot of animatronics which thrilled the kids. The shows were grand too.Final tip : Go during the weekday and if it's a kid centric holiday take the 2 day pass and expect to get a bit bored since adult rides are few and far. The happy kiddie faces will however replace the boredom you face.Must visit for children of all ages."
2045,2017-12,"Kids loved it.... (2 & 4 year old), they couldn't go in all rides, but it was great to see them smile and happy walking around the park.We were lucky and had sunny, breezy days, not too hot and no rain for the 2 days we visited. We saw the whole park, and with small kids, you can't do it all in one day... 2 days are enough, 3 too much... 1 not long enough .....We stayed at the Disney Hollywood hotel, which is on site (free shuttle ride to the park), extremely convenient and very overpriced for what you get... but with small kids, it was very convenient.The park is showing its age, and there is a new park in Shanghai now.... so.... worth having a look around, but if you are going to be HK, its definitely worth a visit for the little ones... probably 5  would get the most of it .... It was great, but I would visit different ones instead of going back there again .... Nice 2 days and worth a visit at least once."
2046,2017-12,1st time visit HongKong Disneyland.The location is near the airport but quite far from the city but you can catch MTR to Disney. Like others feel like back to childhood. The lion king show is recommended.This theme park is suitable for every ages.Not to much crowed and queued for every plaything. Staff really impressed me.for theme park lover must be visit.For others should be visit and spend almost whole day in Disneyland. Don't miss night parade and firework.Poor me at 6th October during waiting for night parade it was raining so     cancel but just after the announcement the rain was stop!
2047,2017-12,"We found the Hong Kong Disney experience overall a great family outing. Plenty of things to do and see and easy to cover in a day. Although the queues were long they were generally less time than the signs indicated. The down side of the day, was the closing of half the park for a private function. Luckily there were plenty of signs and staff at the gate were helpful in suggesting to do that side of the park before it closed to the general public although we did miss a couple of rides. It was also hard to get a photo with some of the characters, always seemed to turn up just as the photo sessions were closing.On the plus side the fireworks show was amazing and well worth staying to see."
2048,2017-12,"Its was a good decision to visit the part in the late afternoon when its less crowded (5min wait time for most rides) and less hot. While we finish our day there, we were treated to a fantastic firework display at 8pm closing the park. Defiantly worth the price of our tickets! "
2049,2017-12,Everything is impressive for our kids 2 and 7 years old except the weather that so hot and the food that quiet pricey. We definitely visit there again.
2050,2017-12,We entered Disneyland at 1pm. The sad thing is they closed all outdoor rides at 1:30 pm. Well they should have informed us before we bought the tickets. We went to Hongkong just to go to Disneyland. The tickets cost us more than 10k pesos (1617 HKD). They already know they're gonna close based on the forecast and yet they still let us buy the tickets. We only stayed inside for an hour or so. We just took pictures and rode the hyperspace mountain and took off. Bad experience. They only want the money... and didnt care if we lose it. 
2051,2017-12,Great disneyland resort! Smaller than some of the others but still full of the usual disney magic. Easy to go round in one day but could spend more time over 2 days if you wanted to meet and greet characters etc. Great lion king show. Good day all round staying for night parade and fireworks. When we visited it was halloween time and themed so the parades seemed short with only 4 floats however thought this may be due to the Halloween theme? Therefore smaller parades as it isn't a permanent feature so not as much budget supplied? Still thoroughly enjoyed.
2052,2017-12,I went to HK disneyland twice and always have the impression that you can cover everything within a day. Avoid mainland China's holiday for shorter line to rides and shows or cleaner toilets.
2053,2017-12,"This is so much fun! Staff were friendly and really lovely!We enjoyed the rides   it was more low key than Ocean Park which is awesome in Hong Kong. I would prefer disneyland for the less thrill seekers. There are rides that are better than others   of course, depends what you are looking for.It was our friends birthday and we got her a badge from City hall, which meant they were very kind when the staff saw her   Happy birthday about 1 million times. Way cute!Really easy to get there by train   lots of friendly people to take photos of.TIP: Please go to the lion king show   amazing!"
2054,2017-12,We have been to Florida and Paris Disneyland and this falls into the Paris side of things. We all enjoyed our day out here and would we promised our girls a trip to Disney when in Hong Kong. It is good and fun for the kids but remember it is NOT Florida size.
2055,2017-12,"Visited with 2 young children. Train to Disneyland is nice. Visited on wkday and not much crowd, short waiting time. Some pushcarts and a few eating places not operating. No selfie stick is allow. The food are expensive. 99% of the staff( fr restaurant or shops or rides assiatance) we came by are unfriendly, no smile and rude. The 1st rude staff is at the self  help ticketing station who keep saying 'no no no no' while walking towards us. These staff really spoil our day. Put on mozzie patch or repellent. Me and my hubby got biten all over the legs which the red spots last many days.Most of the rides are for young children, not much for adult. 2 days visit is good if u want a more relax trip especially with children. We spent 3 4 of the day during the 1st day and half a day on 2nd day for night view. Our verdict: japan disneyland is so much better and fun. Will not revisit in the next few yrs."
2056,2018-1,"Loved this park, having been to the Florida and Paris parks, we found HK smaller, but very nice, we covered most of the park attractions in one day, and stayed for the fantastic fireworks at 8pm.Queues were ok, It was a Monday in October. Easy to get to, MTR to Sunny Bay, then a Disney train to the park, also on the MTR line."
2057,2018-1,This Disneyland is pretty good with the Winnie the Pooh and the Amazon river ride being the best of the lot. When you go there make sure you go there when there is no school holiday in China else you would find it really crowded. Also make sure that you go on weekdays.
2058,2018-1,Had a great time as first time visitors. Staff very friendly and helpful. Can be done in a day but it will be a long one especially if it's hot
2059,2018-1,"The fast pass is the way to go...we both loved Disneyland ,the staff ,the rides the shows were all excellent...Halloween was being celebrated at the time...laughing and scared all at the same time...the nightmare experiment. Went to a lovely Asian restaurant had lobster dumplings and wonton soup .The finale on the castle with the light show and fireworks ...made me wish upon a star ...thanks to all"
2060,2018-1,"If your Kid loves Disney please visit. else not much to do, rides are alittle boring not what I expected. be prepared to walk alot. Depends on when you go, you might have to queue very long."
2061,2018-1,"Disneyland HK feels like a quite compact park. It is a while since I've visited Disneyland Paris and Disney World Orlando and this feels much more designed for small children than the other parks. The park is also small and I think you can plan to do it in half a day. With small children maybe a bit longer.Some attractions are in Chinese only, so understanding what the characters are saying might be a problem.They close most of the attractions very early, already when the parade starts at 7PM, thus don't come too late to the park.Western food is not especially good, tried a hot dog and will never do that again. Very tasteless and strange consistency. There are a lot of Asian style options, maybe they taste better? Have to try next time.Anyhow Disney is always fun and there are some attractions that are quite well suited for adults too e.g. Grizzly Gulch and Hyperspace Mountain."
2062,2018-1,"It's wonderful. Honestly, my friend had been to some of the US Disneyland's and had raved about them, so when we were going to HK, I decided to gift her a day there. I LOVED IT! It is genuinely the happiest place on earth, you should definitely pre book your tickets, and with the MTR you can get there super cheap and easily. You don't need anything more than just your normal entry ticket really. We went on a Saturday, and it was totally fine, we didn't wait any more than 10 mins for a ride, average wait was 1 6 mins. We spent the entire day there (11am 8pm) and I could have used another couple of hours to fit everything in.Definitely recommend the Space Mountain and the runaway carts. They were the thrill seeker rides and I was surprised with Mystic Manor, definitely worth dropping in to. Toy Story will take you back to being a big kid and I dare say would be the best fun for kids.All the highlights of a Disneyworld land are there   teacups, it's a small world etc.AND TOTALLY SEE THE LION KING SHOW TOO!"
2063,2018-1,We were all adults but I am still little Disney lover so enjoyed the place.... rapunzel... Mickey Minnie Mouse... everywhere... small shops giving feel of as if you are in dreamland.... small trains ... forest land with stories of Snow White... it was a nice experience and then ending up with light show was amazing .... one time must visit Lion king show was nice...
2064,2018-1,"Took the family to HK Disneyland earlier this month and while the crowd was manageable this time on a Sunday visit, we were a bit disppointed with some of the programs. The traditional 3pm parade was rather short. The usual characters were there   Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Donald, etc. but the princesses weren't and neither were other more recent characters. The attractions and rides were great and we did get to meet Chewbacca and R2D2 in Tomorrowland, so that was a consolation."
2065,2018-1,"We had an amazing time at Disneyland. It was our first ever so we didn't know what to expect but everything about it was amazing. We don't have children so there was hardly a line for the rides for us 'big kids' while the rides for the kiddies were about 20 30 mins.If you can, try and visit in October so you can take advantage of all the hallowe'en attractions."
2066,2018-1,"This is a small park that you can pretty much have most of the fun within a day. We went on a rather busy Sunday, quite a bit of people, but it was under control with a good flow. Unlike Ocean Park, over flooded with frustrated visitors getting ripped off. Lion King show is our favorite, must do. PS, bring something to snack if you are not a big fan of Chinese food, cause most outlets are focus on catering Chinese visitors,"
2067,2018-1,Disney land Hongkong is for southeast asian countries who can't afford america and europe. Is good that at least asian people whom has a budget price still can enjoy disneyland for a very affordable price. I love it and such a very amazing experience                   
2068,2018-1,"we booked the Spectacular tour which gives you a guided tour of the Disney park for up to 6 people, but also allows you to get on rides faster without long queues. The Tour guides are very knowledgeable and very helpful in assuring that you get the best out of your 3 hour tour"
2069,2018-1,"Pls Go early. Very good, you can enjoy all raid and show. Food is also good but costly. Worth spending time and money"
2070,2018-1,HKG Disneyland was an expensive disappointment. Time and money better spent !  Go to Ocean Park.  Especially if your hotel is on the Island side.
2071,2018-1,Nice day out even if haven't got kids. Reasonably priced event. Easy get to via the MTR. Take in the Star Wars live shows great for getting kids involved. All the Disney attractions and characters you would expect to see. But one of my favourite parts of this site is the 3D cinema. Where you are not only watching 3D which lets face it is everywhere now. But you also get the wind the rain and the smells from the show.
2072,2018-1,"It's cool , value for money , awesum place for children's but cannot go second time even  i get free pass"
2073,2018-1,The Disney land has been made beautifully and divided into simple zones to enjoy the full day. Variety of rides and attractions are available for all age groups and the place is artistically made. Several restaurants are all around the park and serve varieties of cuisine to suit everyone's tastes and preferences. Great place to go with kids and family. 
2074,2018-1,The last time I was in HK Disney was 2012 and I was with my siblings. This time around it was with my own family and I was expecting the same but I was surprised to see a lot of things new like Star Wars and others and it felt like a new experience! It's a definite must go to in Hongkong for children and young at heart.
2075,2018-2,"Super easy and cheap to get to by the dedicated train, the usual gift shops, not many 'rides' although the big grizzly mountain and the parachute ride from Toy Story were a scream!! I didn't think we would spend more than a couple of hours but actually arrived at 10 and left at about three. It was quiet when we went (on a Friday) so the queues were bearable in the heat. We were In Hong Kong for ten nights so it was a day trip but if there for less I'm not sure it would be high on my priorities"
2076,2018-2,A nice place to go to if you have a few hours to spare in HK .... great shopping locations.... 2 amazing roller coasters... a truely happy place...
2077,2018-2,"Waited my whole life to see Disneyland, it was worth the wait! Parade at 4:30 let us see all of our favorite characters. Just wished they had screens showing old cartoons. Go with or without kids! Great!!"
2078,2018-2,"More than a day is needed to cover all aspects of this theme park. Fun and safe   more for young children than teenagers, unless it's just a fun activity for those young at heart!"
2079,2018-2,"Hong Kong Disneyland is an awesome experience as long as you do not go to the park on the Monday following the National Day celebrations in Hong Kong (1st October 2016).We found that a lot of the locals and those from the Mainland took the Monday off after the National Day public holiday which increased the number of people going to Disneyland by 200%.The increase in the number of people means long queues, long waits for rides, rude and ignorant people jostling and or sprinting for rides.Avoid the Monday at all costs and go on the Tuesday where you will avoid all of the above and enjoy the park a great deal more."
2080,2018-2,"Great experience for first timers. Must try rides include Grizzly Gulch and The Nightmare Experiments. Very good actors in The Nightmare Experiments. Different creepy sensation due to its human actors. However the actors need to be very careful for the personal space. What good about machine is that it is already designed for the human safety but if the machine is replaced by human actors, creativity can be happening during the show and for sure it must not violate the safety rules. For me, I don't prefer human actors especially in the horror rides."
2081,2018-2,"From the previous TA reviews I was thinking a trip out to the happiest place on earth was going to be a day spent in queues. I was pleasantly surprised. With a 10 & 12 year old in tow, we joined the queue at the front of the park and it turned out to be the longest wait. About 30 minutes. The rides in the park with the longest queues seemed to be at the infant rides. It was a week day and we got there as the gates opened, which contributed."
2082,2018-2,This park isn't as nice as the one in Japan Anaheim Paris Orlando or Shanghai. It's smaller and lacks the charm of the others. Not as many places to eat and frankly it's a little boring.  The staff is friendly however.
2083,2018-2,Parks should have limitation on the capacity of what the park can hold. I cant believe we stood for 1 and a half hour outside the park just to get inside under the hot sun. Inside the park. you can barely see the park attendants. no one is there to assist you. all the rides are still the same compared to when I last went there when I was just a kid. It seems like they made no effort to change the rides except to change the name of the rides depending what cartoon is trending.Place is small and crowded. It was supposed to be a magical exprience for us. But now. I will never go back here again
2084,2018-2,The price to get in here was pretty steep for what you get for it. The Gulch mine cart ride was well worth it and the boat trip around the island at adventure land (I think) was entertaining. The Star Wars ride was thrilling through pitch darkness but the wait for this ride was ridiculous and no fans or coolers to keep such a large number of people cool in high heat and humidity while they wait. We just waited for long periods of time in line after line for short rides. There weren't too many spots to sit down to rest and you could only buy the designated branded items on sale at their high prices for food and drinks. The family were pretty frazzled by early afternoon and we pulled the pin only to have to wait in lines for the train to stand all the way back to the hotel. 
2085,2018-2,"We are regular visitors and love the place. Great entertainment, small enough so you can get to all the rides, their is plenty to do but the popular rides do get busy by 11.00 am so get there early and the queues are very short. By the afternoon expect to queue so grab a show and relax. "
2086,2018-2,"Didn't actually visit the park, rather went around the free areas (which was a decent morning activity). Still plenty to see, navigating the open fountain, the pier and seeing the hotels. Getting to the park by the MTR is a treat in itself. Cute Disney themed train and an impressive station to please the child inside you. We went early to beat the crowds and breathe in the fresh air. The hordes start to swarm in later, so do take note (we got many unobstructed shots of the sign and fountain early on). Will be back to actually enter the park. Review coming soon to a TripAdvisor near you. "
2087,2018-2,We really enjoyed outlet day at Disneyland. It was not busy like Anaheim. There are not as many attractions as Disneyland in Anaheim so it's easy to go around in 1 day. The attractions that are the same as Anaheim still have slight differences which was really good. Definitely a must to see!
2088,2018-2,"I am glad we got a 2 day pass, and not just 1!We took three children (2,5,8), with us to Disneyland and had a ball, actually wished we had stayed longer.We did stay at the hotel too, so that is definitely what added to the experience.We all loved it   we were also lucky as we went during the week so there were no big crowds.The staff are all friendly and helpful and the whole experience for the kids is just great.The only disappointment for us is the price of everything! On our first day we stopped and got burgers chips and drinks in one of the restaurants.....it cost us nearly $200 AUD......I just think the resort (inc the hotels ), needs a reasonably priced supermarket!Other than that though, just a great experience for the whole family!!!Jedi training and  it's a small world  we're a hit with my kids "
2089,2018-2,"Only down falls not enough sitting area, shaded areas and drinks are very expensive. (Day was extremely hot.) Tuesday seemed to be an excellent day as we never waited longer than 10 min for anything."
2090,2018-2,"Had a great day with wife and three kids between 5 and 11. Visited on a Monday and the crowds were small, walked straight onto most rides all day. Staff very friendly and entertaining. Even some lower key attractions, like 4D movie, were very enjoyable. Food better price and quality than expected. These positives more than made up for hot weather and the park being smaller than those in US and Paris. Found Disney characters much more accessible at this park, there were lots all day and all very accessible and entertaining. A must do for 1 day when in Hong Kong. We stayed from open to closing fireworks.  "
2091,2018-2,"We bought a 2 day ticket for disneyland. There were no queues when we went and we were a easily able to complete all the attractions within a couple of hours. Because it was so hot and humid we ended up having 2 half days there which actually worked out really well.There aren't that many attractions for those without young children. One of the best was a Halloween special called Mickey's Laboratory which was excellent but very scary! There are a couple of roller coasters and a 3d cinema, plus the simpler rides like winnie the pooh.Food seemed reasonably priced and varied. It's a small park, much smaller than Paris and Orlando. But they seem to be building more attractions all of the time. Looks like the new Iron Man will be opening soon. What is there is of super high quality like you would expect from Disney.Worth a visit for the authentic Disney experience but don't expect to be there long!"
2092,2018-2,This Disneyland isn't much if you're looking for a theme park with rides. Most of them were rides I think only children under 5 would enjoy apart from the three thrill rides! The lion king show was great however the way they had people queuing seemed dangerous as when they put the rope down people were running and pushing passed each other. I wouldn't recommend it to adults and I'm a big Disney fan. Skip this one and go to a better Disneyland.
2093,2018-2,"We were pretty excited to here, but when it took us nearly an hr and a half from the start of the parking line until we got into the park, we didn't start the day real strong. Plan ahead, prebuy tickets and don't park onsite.The lines weren't real bad for the rides, approx a half hour and the fast pass is really good. It was unfortunate that a couple of the good big rides were shutdown when we were there.It is really neat to see the  production  and how clean everything is.Unless you are a big Disney person, some of the other theme parks are better for the rides"
2094,2018-2,"As 15 time visitors to Disney World, my 17 year old daughter and I were excited to see the original. We enjoyed the rides, the ambiance, comparing each park's version of the same rides, and overall Disney ness."
2095,2018-2,the best disney park in the world  love that the two parks are so close to one another  recommeded to stay in the nearby hotels  it takes two days to do everything
2096,2018-3,Everyone in the world knows about Disneyland. It is really one of the best places to have fun whether you are a kid or a kid at heart.There rides and shows for every age group and the place keeps improving and expanding. My favorites are Space Mountain at Tomorrow Land and Indiana Jones in Adventureland.I can't wait for Starwars Land to open.
2097,2018-3,"Shoulder to shoulder, hot with minimal shade, lines too long to actually go on anything.After several dismissive interactions with staff the whole horrible weekend culminated in me sitting on a bench and crying, while passersby (and  cast members ) pretended not to see me.I've never felt less valued as a customer. I wish we'd saved the money. I would never go back."
2098,2018-3,"If you are in Southern California, then you must go to Disneyland Theme park. Is the best place to be at whether you have children or want to go as an adult. Love it."
2099,2018-3,"What can I say, its the original Disneyland, crowded, expensive, but still great.  Get a park hopper and go to both parks."
2100,2018-3,"We've been here twice now, and we're already planning our third visit.We just love it here... It's the happiest place on earth.We're careful to time our visits with the low periods, so we aren't attending while it is packed. The walk up the main street towards the iconic castle is a memory that I'll always treasure.The rides are many and varied; from the old world charm of the storybook rides and the teacups, to the excitement of space mountain; There's something for everyone.My teenage boys went off on their own as soon as we entered the park, while my wife and I cruised around with our parents and our toddler, enjoying the baby rides in the storybook area.We were able to go back to our motel to give our son a snooze in the really hot part of the day, and then come back in the evening for the fireworks... a moment that took my breath away.We spent several days there, and I'm certain there are things that we still didn't see.We'll be back!"
2101,2018-3,"I usually visit with family, this time I made a solo trip to treat myself. Disney is fun for young or old...i thoroughly enjoyed myself at a slower pace, solo one day, and second day met up with a friend who lives locally. October was brilliant time visit, a little more than a week away from Halloween. Decor was spectacular, food festive."
2102,2018-3,It was my first visit to Disneyland and I am glad that I went as an adult! It was so much more fun! I loved all the rides but in particular the Star wars ride. It was a little scary at first because it is like you are in space! Love the chocolate nut bananas. Took a photo with Mickey Mouse! LOVED DISNEYLAND!!
2103,2018-3,"We love all the attractions, my kids love every minute we spend here. very professional and courteous staff. we will back soon."
2104,2018-3,"Who doesnt want to go to Disney? I will say the temp in SoCal is much more forgiving than Orlando since humidity is limited. The size of the park however is much smaller than Disney World, if your your kids behave, lines arent too long, you could probably hit most of the park in a day. 3 days is certainly plenty of time to get it all in when traveling with kids. "
2105,2018-3,"I will never grow old of Disneyland. It truly is the happiest place on earth. Stay at a Disney hotel if you want the whole experience, but if you're on a budget save money by staying off site and it won't take away from your trip."
2106,2018-3,The best if you hate crowds. In one hour shopped rode jungle cruise pirates of the Caribbean and haunted mansion. Unbelievable.     
2107,2018-3,We visited during the Halloween season and the park was amazingly decorated and the the characters were as well! Had a amazing time with the family. We really enjoyed our time!
2108,2018-3,I'm a Disney fanatic so this was really fun for me. There are rides for people of all ages interests so no one had to feel left out. I participated in the  Walking in Walt's Disneyland Footsteps  Tour and ate at many restaurants including Blue Bayou (my fave) and River Belle Terrace. Hope to visit again. 
2109,2018-3,"I love Disneyland and have been many times. Some tips to make things as magical as possible:1.Be sure to arrive at least 30 60 minutes before park opening. Being there when the park opens allows you ride multiple rides without lines as well as experience the magic of a park that isn't overwhelmed with people. Walking on a main street that isn't chalk full of crowds is amazing.2. We typically hit fantasyland first as you can get through the entire land very quickly & avoid waits. As the day goes on the lines get crazy. Especially for Peter Pan.3. A good place to see parades is near frontierland.4. Use fast passes. This will minimize wait time and get be effective in ensuring you are able do to the rides you really want. Effective planning can ensure you get to ride all the rides plus your favorites a few times.5. Character breakfasts minimize park time waiting in line to meet characters.6. My not miss attractions include: Big Thunder Mountain Rail Road, Space Mountain, Tea Cups, Alice in Wonderland, Mr. Toad, Peter Pan, Matterhorn, Pirates of the Caribbean, Main Street Electric Parade, Star Tours.7. Food is expensive, but I enjoy the corndog from the red wagon on main street. Also Bengal BBQ across from Indiana Jones is a great bang for your buck. 8. Disneyland is a local park   avoid weekends whenever possible as that is when the locals go8. Get Park Hoppers!! Disney California Adventure is literally within a 10 minutes walk. the Park Hoper is totally worth it because you can experience both parks. I would suggest that you need at least 3 days to enjoy all the parks at a relaxed pace."
2110,2018-3,"Loved every minute of it, we went around Halloween time which was busier than expected.  Still had a great time, the 6 and 4 year old want to go back every time we talk about our next vacation."
2111,2018-3,"Me and my husband visited Disney during our 3 week honeymoon around the Los Angeles area. We had  Just Married  shirts made up for our trip. So many members of staff noticed our shirts and could always talk to us and congratulate us. Some even gave us fast pass tickets to use immediately just because! So cute! We found this park to be so incredibly busy all the time, the California Adventure Park was definitely less crowded. A few of the attractions were closed when we visited which was a bit of a let down. I didn't think wed manage to get to go on space mountain but it opened on our last visit! Our favourite rides were definitely Pirates of the Caribbean, Snow White's Scary Adventure (she's my favourite princess) and Thunder Mountain!"
2112,2018-3,"I think the still Disneyland Park need lots of customer service and ADA training, other then that fun place."
2113,2018-3,"We are Disney fanatics! We were a little surprised by the size of the park only because we have gone to Disney World a zillion times. It was much smaller than what we were used to, but it was still awesome. We visited during the Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween event which had plenty of trick or treating!!! Also, the Haunted Mansion was magical. 3 adults will NOT fit easily in the ride together though. Also, Space Mountain's special Halloween show  awesome! It is more comfortable than the Orlando one as well. No magic bands used here yet and we did not know they still did fast passes at the kiosks until it was too late in the day."
2114,2018-3,You can't possibly regret visiting a Disney park for Halloween.  The trick or treating is beyond belief.
2115,2018-3,There is definitely wonder at the magic kingdom!  California adventure was great too. Have to go back. Halloween parade was awesome
2116,2018-3,"Booked my stay via a Costco package for October 2016 which included the room, Disneyland California Adventure 3 day hopper tickets, a Disney gift card, free Disney lanyard with pin for each person in my group, and character dining. Check in was smooth and quick. I was upgraded to a room overlooking downtown Disney and California Adventure. And even though we arrived a couple hours before check in time, we were able to get our room right away.The upgraded room allowed us to enjoy the amazing nightly fireworks show in clear view from the comfort of our room to the left at Disneyland and to the right we could see the World of Color show at California Adventure.Beds were very comfortable, room very spacious, and we LOVED the musical headboard! So charming...especially for my son.Hotel very convenient close to the park gates. Right next to the monorail. And if you prefer to walk  which we did  it is about an 8 10 min walk to the gates depending on your pace. Several restaurants and shops nearby (such as two Starbucks on each end of downtown Disney, Rainforest Cafe, and my son's favorite  the LEGO store, to name a few).We also LOVED the pool area which included a monorail water slide. It seemed almost as if my son enjoyed the water slide area more than the parks itself ; ). Several lifeguards as well to ensure everyone's safety. I was impressed with how many lifeguards they had on duty.When we checked out we still had about 3 hours to spare before we needed to head to the airport. The front desk kindly provided a key designated for the pool area and welcome us to hang out and enjoy the pool until we needed to leave. So that was a pleasant surprise. There are showers outside by the pools next to bathrooms which we used to get ready (but only cold water) before departing for airport.Hotel is indeed pricey. I do wish it could be more affordable. However, the Costco package and experience of the hotel definitely made it worthwhile. And I hope to stay at the Disneyland Hotel again in the future."
2117,2018-4,"It's Disneyland! I love it. We go to Disney World Florida every other year or so but since we live on the other side of the country our visits to Disneyland aren't as numerous but they are special. I recommend visiting between October and December so you can experience the Nightmare Before Christmas Haunted Mansion ride layover, it's really fantastic. In November Small World is all decked out for Christmas with the dolls singing Jingle Bells instead of the usually song. There are rides here you won't find in Disneyworld and this park is smaller so you can do it all in 1 or 2 days. We stay for 4 or 5 and see California Adventure Park too and usually an outside area attraction (hollywood, san diego, etc)."
2118,2018-4,"If you can, a 3 Day Ticket to the Disneyland Resort is a must! This allows you to spend two days in Disneyland and one day in California Adventure. Disneyland is best during the offseason, (Mid January Early May excluding spring break) where crowds are low. You can experience most of the park. This does come with a trade off, quite a bit of the park can be under refurbishment construction. There are several tools online to help with trip planning and I would suggest Disneyland Crowd Calendar. This can help you find what times are typically busy. Another useful tool is the refurbishment schedule that can be found on touringplans.com. Food can be expensive if you choose to go to a premium dining location. If you are looking for a good dining location for a date, I would suggest the blue bayou. You can expect a $100 bill at the end, but the meal is definitely worth it. The atmosphere is romantic and the food is amazing."
2119,2018-4,"The magic is all around you here. Perfect for little ones. Disney isn't cheap, but it's definitely worth it."
2120,2018-4,"We'll be back soon! 5 days, and 72 miles walked, 3 pounds lost and I can't wait to get back to the happiest place on earth!"
2121,2018-4,We did a family trip last fall and everyone had a blast! From my little nephews (ages 5 and 7) to in laws and grandparents   our group had non stop fun and endless entertainment! Take advantage of those Magic Mornings. Get up early and hit the parks when they first open to take advantage of short wait times. We often met back up for breakfast around 9am when the park opened to the general public. Also the Halloween Party is MUST!
2122,2018-4,"I'll keep this short. Disneyland is awesome. My tips are get there early, like before the gates open. Prior to going download the Disneyland app and have a look at which rides have the longest wait times. That way, when you get there at opening time, make a rush to those rides with the longest waits, as we found there was not as many people first thing in the morning. Also try and get fast passes where possible. We found by getting there first thing in the morning within a couple of hours we had done all the rides with the larger wait times. We then had the luxury of cruising around doing all the smaller rides in the afternoon."
2123,2018-4,"I LOVE Disneyland. It should be on everyone's bucket list. I'm often asked questions by coworkers going to America, and I tell them all do not miss this   they all tell me  thank you for convincing me to go, it was the best day   that's from 21 year old females to 65 year old men. It is the ultimate theme park. The detail in their rides is phenomenal. Does it have the biggest rides? No. The lines are long but if you go early and hit the main attractions first you will be happy. To make the most of the place I recommend  The Unofficial Guide to Disneyland    it's a book or a weblink that gives you an order to do the park, and if you follow their touring plans, you don't wait more than 20 minutes in a queue. I've done it so many times and it's the way to go. Also go on a weekday if you can. "
2124,2018-4,"My son (almost 9) and I visited on the first Sunday of October   we got there before the gate opened so we were ready to go right off the bat. We went to Star Tours first thing to get a fast pass but the line wasn't very long so my son went ahead and rode. We met some nice people in line and they allowed him to ride with their kids, that way I didn't have to worry about him while he was riding. I stayed with him until he boarded then they allowed me to walk through and wait on the other side. I was afraid he might get scared but he didn't. We then went to get him signed up for Jedi Training   he got one of the last spots available later in the day. We then went to get a fast pass for Splash Mountain but ended up just going on the ride as the long was really short   we both loved it. We took ponchos so we weren't worried about being wet first thing in the morning. After that we got a fast pass for Big Thunder Mountain then went to Jungle Cruise, which we both loved. Our guide was so funny, I know it is a script, but she was fabulous. That was a pretty long line but we got it over with early. We did Autopia twice   first time together the second time he drove his own car and he did much better. It's a Small World did not disappoint   line wasn't outrageous and moved pretty quickly   it has been years since I went to Disneyworld, so I was excited to go on this ride again. We also loved the teacup ride and did it probably about 6 times   he didn't think he would enjoy it, but loved it especially when we really got it spinning pretty fast. That line was short so we got through it pretty quick. He spent some time in the kiddie land area then we rode the Gadget Go Coaster. Big Thunder Mountain we did fairly early in the morning and I loved it more than I thought   I was a little nervous about it due to back issues, but it wasn't a problem at all. I would have gone again, but he wasn't up for it. He was a little pale when we got off and kept saying he was going to throw up while on it. After he sat down for a couple of minutes he was fine and ready to go. Don't miss the apple freeze with boysenberry   that is possibly one of the best drinks I have ever had and my son agreed. We split a corn dog and fries   got water to drink  which is free   so that was a pretty cheap lunch. We also had a churro, pretzel and pineapple whip   only spent around $30 on food for the day and were well satisfied because we were so busy! The Jedi Training show was so good   even if my child wouldn't have been participating. I had no idea what to expect   I thought they were just going to be showing them some moves, boy was I surprised. He got to  fight  Darth Vader   the photographer got better photos than I did, so I was pleased with that. The photo pass is pretty cool   however we only saw 1 photographer   however we had the Jedi training photos, the ones at the castle and then our ride photo. I made a mistake by not downloading the photos when I purchased them   I didn't know they didn't stay on there until you were ready to download. Fortunately when I called, I got a sweet girl who found my photos and made them available for me to download. Don't miss the light in the window at the fire station on main street near the entrance. That light now stays on all the time   when Walt Disney was alive   that light was on whenever he was at the park. Very nice tribute. All in all we had a great time   were there longer than we thought we would be which was completely fine and would go back again if we had the chance."
2125,2018-4,Went to Disneyland for Halloween. Halloween is now my favorite time to come to Disneyland. They really put on quite a show and all the Halloween themed rides were awesome. Mickey's Halloween Party is the serious best way to get on rides without the bad wait times. I definitely will come for Halloween again.
2126,2018-4,"The original is a must visit.  No where near as extensive as Disney World; but, if you are on the West Coat, it is certainly worth a visit.  You will leave happier than when you arrived (guaranteed)."
2127,2018-4,"First time in SoCal. My boyfriend and I are HUGE Disney fans. We are in our late twenties and we are that couple in the park with our light up Disney ears and Mickey shirts on. We got to the park early, right when they opened. Parking was a breeze with many lanes open so it was not as congested. Parking staff were very visible and easy to follow. Parking spaces are larger than average so if you have a van or larger vehicle, do not worry. Getting on the tram ride to the park was easy. Instructions from staff and the speaker system were clear and helpful. This is where we learned that selfie sticks are not allowed in the park. We didn't want to walk all the way back to our vehicle so we just let security confiscate it at the gate. TIP: Please check on their prohibited items before you go, so you don't have to give up your stuff or go all the way back to your car!The park was very very crowded. Getting around was difficult to maneuver. BUT we found that if you were kind to others, they were kind back. That is the MAJOR key here, people. We let others go in front of us, we held the doors open for others, we apologized if we bumped into others, and it made the experience a much more positive one and we noticed the kindness spread like a domino effect. We were bumped by more children than adults, but we didn't mind. We even gave up our spots in some of the theater shows for the families with small children or elderly family members. I think our kindness paid off because we were walking to the restroom and out from a secret door came Pluto and Mickey with cast members. They were heading to a photo op spot, but took a photo with us (that I've attached)!!Another TIP: We played charades and guessing games while waiting in line, making friends along the way. We introduced ourselves to people we met and got to know them. Time flew by REALLY quick this way. We'd recognize the friends that we had made from the lines all over the park, which was awesome because they'd give us the scoop on wait times or other important info, like  The Finding Nemo ride just broke down, don't head that way!  It was REALLY helpful instead of wasting time finding out yourself. Yes, there are apps that will tell you wait times but we found that they aren't as accurate. The lines for the rides averaged about an hour per ride. We utilized the Fast Passes which helped tons. Our strategy was to head straight for the Haunted Mansion first, since the wait on that one and Space Mountain would average over 2 hours throughout the day. If you grab yourself a map, and strategically work your way around all the rides   it is much easier time wise. Then when you are done with the rides, go around for food, photo ops, and then check out the Castle. Now, my biggest reason for writing this review: we were heading towards Space Mountain and two women came up to us and asked if we wanted their Fast Passes for Star Tours. We happily accepted. They told us they weren't going to use them and they didn't want them to go to waste. We were in awe of our luck. We went into Star Tours and our luck was dimmed quickly as we actually got misplaced by the staff. They did a head count for each row of the ride. They over counted and when we were just about to board, it filled up and we were stuck in the loading area. We didn't know where to go so we waited for the staff to come back and get us. They asked us why we weren't on the ride and we explained someone miscounted. So they moved us to another row with the next load. We missed it again, due to it being full again. They moved us to where the ride operators were standing, we waited awkwardly for ride space to open up. Right before we finally got on, a cast member came up to us and apologized for them messing up and handed us a small card. We tucked it into our pocket and finished the ride. Afterward, we headed to Space mountain which had OVER a 2 hour wait. We read the card we received, it stated that we were allowed to get on any ride of our choice for that date through the fast pass lane. Our good luck came back! We were able to ride Space Mountain without having to wait at all, thanks to that cast member. We had no idea they could do that so DISNEY, please keep it up. Please keep allowing your cast members the privilege to make up for mistakes like that through those cards! Ironically, we also found a pair of Minnie Ears on the ride's seat pouches after we rode. We tried to find the owner but couldn't. We decided to pay it forward and find a little girl to give the ears to. The family thanked us a million times and were in shock. We only hoped we helped uplift their day as well. All in all, yes we had a lot of hiccups throughout our day. BUT, as cheesy as it sounds, if you go in with a really positive and kind attitude, you should have a really amazing time."
2128,2018-4,"Love this place. If traveling from the UK or anywhere for that matter go to Guest Services and book your self a Disney Walk in Walt's footsteps tour, you will not be disappointed... The Halloween special ticket was worth the extra money, but taken advantage of not using your day ticket as you can use you Halloween ticket from 1500hrs.We could of done with using the day at the end of our holiday..But we have learnt by our mistakes!The Harvey Family x "
2129,2018-4,"I may be a 56 year old grandma, but I still love Disneyland. Yes, there are crowds. Yes, you have to wait in lines sometimes. But, they do such a good job of keeping it a good, clean atmosphere and the rides take you back to the fairy tales that you grew up with. I will always love Disneyland."
2130,2018-4,We visited this park exactly 10 years ago and appreciated some of the new updates. The haunted house has finally been revamped! Old favorites remained and the old submarine ride is now Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage. Still cute. The park is a great day's time for all ages.Highly Recommended!
2131,2018-4,"I love going to Disneyland. My husband and I have an annual pass and go often. Some days we just ride rides, some days we just watch shows and sometimes we just walk around. I'm impressed that there is always something new to do. The staff is always friendly and helpful. There are many different types of food. Things are kind of pricey ($10 15 per meal). This is a great place for kids and adults. "
2132,2018-4,"Yes it was busy, crazily so on the day we went, but it was still worth it. With a little bit of planning we managed to get around the whole park over the course of the day and evening and got to ride all the rides we wanted to. Space Mountain was fantastic and we didn't even have to queue for that!! And, of course, we got to meet Mickey Mouse. Great day."
2133,2018-4,Our overall experience was fantastic. It will definitely be something that we and especially the children will remember. My 12 year old daughter was over the moon at Disneyland park whilst my 6 year old son preferred California Park but they both thoroughly enjoyed both parks as my wife and I did. All rides and entertainment are second to none. One of the most visited places by tourists and definitely NOT one to be missed as it will be memorable for all.
2134,2018-4,"We choose to go with kids on Columbus Day weekend. We're from out of town so we didn't have a choice. It was super crowded and it happen to be very warm. If we weren't staying at Grand California, it would have been very challenging. Disney does theme parks well. It's the best."
2135,2018-4,"Loved Disneyland. Having grown up with mickey it has been a life long dream to visit Disney   and you couldn't wipe the smile off my face for the moment I arrived to the moment I left. Bought my mouse ears & had a ball. Going late in October, as winter approaches, is the perfect time   the weather is great (jeans & tshirt) and the crowds are scarce. The longest wait we had was for the mattahorn   a massive 20 minutes!!! Used the fast passes properly (got one every two hours) for pirates & Indiana jones   but the rest of the rides were pretty much straight on. My boy is 13 & had a ball. He preferred the rides at California park but the atmosphere of Disney. Stay for the parade, it fulfills every childhood Disney Dream. A little bit of morning drizzle (yes, in California!) didn't dampen our spirits. For kids under 12 make a bee line to Star Wars & sign up to learn to be a Jedi   you might get to fight against darth vadar. It really is the happiest place on earth!"
2136,2018-4,Going without young kids definitely changes the fun of the park but it was as amazing as you expect it to be. Fast passes help a lot and using the Disneyland app to find out where characters would be for photo opportunities helped a lot too. Mickeys Halloween party was a really cool thing to do as well so I definitely recommend trick or treating there if you go at Halloween. 
2137,2018-4,We loved Disneyland!  So much history being Walt Disneys first created Park.  We loved all of the Halloween decorations and celebrating Halloween at Disneyland!  October early November are a great time to visit Disneyland.
2138,2018-5,"Mickey's Halloween party is awesome, please consider it in the future. Prices have definitely gone up over last year. Something had to pay for Star Wars."
2139,2018-5,"We visited this park at Halloween and enjoyed the Halloween parade and trick or treating.It was really busy but the queues for things weren't that long and some of the rides were actually better in the dark.We were able to see most characters in the park although there were long waits for a few like the princesses.Everyone here was really friendly, even the people in costumes were happy to talk, it didn't feel rushed at all.I suggest getting the app so you can see the ride times and the character times, although the staff walking around are really helpful with this information. We got a photo pass but it really wasn't necessary if you have a decent camera as they are happy to take pictures with your own device.We didn't get any fast track passes, I'm glad we didn't because we didn't need them. The food wasn't great at all! That was the only down side. "
2140,2018-5,There is something magical about this place. The fact that my 4 year old daughter and 92 year old grandma could both be equally entertained was truly amazing. The Halloween party was fantastic! A bucket list must!
2141,2018-5,Disneyland was fantastic! The parades and shows were excellent. we went on most of the rides and enjoyed them all. Everything is very well organized and the staff do an excellent job in maintaining a safe environment. When you go make sure you take advantage of the  fast pass  system! It works well and saves waiting in line for the popular rides. Allow at least 3 4 days to enjoy all the rides and shows. you will want to do some twice!
2142,2018-5,"Excellent! Disneyland never gets old, I love Disneyland    Perfect time to go as we had never been during Halloween. It was not too hot or cold and didn't experience any long lines, great time!"
2143,2018-5,"Thoroughly enjoyed our time playing in the park, something for everyone to do, a mixture of classic rides and new updates.Love the Halloween Christmas layovers on some of the traditional rides too.A couple of walkways got very crowded with people and were slow to navigate and queues at times were a bit crazy, not sure the park was quite built for the capacity it's taking.Wish they'd have a separate security line for guests without bags, very frustrating queuing behind people who need their bags searching..."
2144,2018-5,I was shocked to see how much the entrance to Disney has increased. We visited on Sunday 30th October and opted for single day hopper passes. I was shocked to see that the price was $160 bucks each... $320 total...Thank god no kids in tow! Granted I have not visited there since 2004 but I am sure that back them a three day hopper cost me less...Trying to cram in both parks into a single day means that it is nigh on impossible to do everything which equals very poor value. On top of this some of the Disneyland staples like Splash Mountain and Its A Small World were closed. Could not get on The Tower of Terror due to120 mins line which was fairly consistent for the whole day. Oh I almost forgot if you are driving add another $18 for parking. Also when you are in you are locked into the ridiculous prices of food and drink like $4 for a bottle of water!...Talk about daylight robbery! The whole price of the thing now seems a total rip off and is disproportionate to the experience that you get once inside...The whole thing has left a sour taste so will probably not be visiting again. : (
2145,2018-5,"This place is so commercialize, so full of people, it is not really enjoyable for me. I do not have much good to say."
2146,2018-5,"Definitely recommend you to come. This is the best Disneyland I have been to (my others included HK, Tokyo and Paris). The California world is the highlight for me. First it is unique to the LA Disneyland and second it is very new and has all the Pixar related worlds. I would recommend you to spend two days at least if you can afford the time there. And also consider going on a Friday as they closes at 12 instead of 5 or 6pm.Now my wife and I will definitely go to Florida's one which is the largest in the world. Mr Disney really wants all of us to be happy. "
2147,2018-5,Pretty well I can say all the same things here that I said about Disney Adventure Park! Here you would have the Disney characters to please the kids and sign autographs.
2148,2018-5,"My family and I went to Disneyland once again to enjoy the use of our annual passes and to get our quarterly Disney fix.On this particular visit we were really lucky that the crowds were low and the lines were short. We were able to see the park all decorated for Halloween and it was absolutely amazing. The staff, the decorations, and the parades were all just awesome to see. The Halloween snacks looked great, and seeing Disney all a glow in orange was truly spectacular.So as usual I can say we really don't have any complaints, As Disney lived up to the Disney level of customer service. Thank you very much Walt rest in peace and thank you for Disneyland. Will see you real soon"
2149,2018-5,"I was in Anaheim for a day (10am   7pm) and thought I would check it out since I love Disney so much. The food, drinks and souvenirs are definitely not worth the price they are charging. Most of the attractions i found were for young kids and the wait times for the rides were an hour or more."
2150,2018-5,"I was a season passholder when my kids were younger, and we don't go as often now, but when we do we love it. We were just there before Halloween and all their decorations are awesome. Something so special and magical about the Disney parks. It's an expensive tickets but so much better than any other theme park around."
2151,2018-5,"Is there any better way to describe Disneyland?? MAGICAL! We traveled with a family of five   four adults and one child. :) I think the adults had just as good a time as the kiddo. The entire experience was unforgettable.And, it's not just about the rides. It's about the entire ambiance. The characters, the shops, the dining. It's all so fantastic.My husband and I have had several conversations about the cost of Disneyland and although it is, by no means, considered  cheap,  it is a bargain for the experience we gained. In other words, it was worth every single penny."
2152,2018-5,"This was our first to Disneyland California the time we visited was off peak but it was so busy dread to think what peak time is like. We arrived for opening but it took over an hour to get into the park. We got fastpasses as soon as we entered the park which was a good job as the lines after were nearly an hour and over so didn't manage that many rides which was disappointing. Getting around the park was a nightmare people were queuing in the walkways,I honestly think there were just too many people allowed in to make an enjoyable experience. We got a good spot to watch the parade which was enjoyable and we were glad to visit the original Disneyland after many trips to Disneyworld in Florida. We loved the theming of the whole park and seeing the castle. We especially liked the  it's a small world  ride. "
2153,2018-5,I have visited Disneyland about 25 times over the last 40 or so years. I have seen many changes. I took my children when they were young. I have taken some of my grandkids here. This was the worst ever visit. The price is way too expensive. Much of the park was closed. Even Small World was closed. The steamship Columbia doesn't move. Tom Sawyer Island... closed. Old Bear Country area closed. Then they closed the park at 6PM so they could charge another $70 for Mickey's Halloween party. Greed is the word of the day now at  The Most Expensive Place on Earth .
2154,2018-5,"The happiest place on earth! And nothing can go wrong with this, except for the fact that it is always crowded. But hey, everytime Im here I feel like I can be free!"
2155,2018-5,"We visited Disneyland during the time period that everyone again states that it's the slowest post of the season and the park should be empty. Well apparently 1 persons definition of empty is the opposite of mine. Out of our 5 day trip, only 1 morning for 2 hours wasn't absolutley jam packed solid. What amazes me is the sheer volume of people that openly talk about pulling their kids out of school to go to Disneyland for a day. 3 5 days all of toontown was closed except for Micky and Minnie's house. With 1 3rd of the park already closed to build Star Wars, that's simply unacceptable. On several occasions I witnessed children playing with wheelchairs, yet when they went up to rides and adult would sit in it and act injured, when the ride was over they'd get up and walk normally allowing the kids to play in the chair again until the next ride. Disneyland has a horrible policy on disabled persons. To allow that type of abuse is simply ridiculous.AP days are a joke, we got a bottle of water and a tiny pin and got to stand outside in the 95 degree heat, yippee. Last time they had bags of popcorn and it was inside an air conditioned building.With kids back in school the park didn't open until 10am. seriously, that's way too late to open a park that is supposed to cater to small children.The best pointer I can pass along is that whichever park has magic morning, go to the other park instead. The park with magic morning is already overrun and you'll just be standing in line to stand in line again."
2156,2018-5,Disneyland really needs to get with the fastpass way of life as that of Disneyworld. They have construction going on for the StarWars area which didnt worry us too much.The time we visited wasnt very crowded but Fastpasses are a must and especially with a young family. Hopper pass was a must for us as unfortunately we were there when Halloween party was on and they closed the park to the special event a couple of times a week so that was a nuisance but we worked it out.
2157,2018-5,What can one say. Was here 42 years ago and it's STILL as enjoyable as it was then. Was a little disappointed in the parade and the fire works and It's a small world was closed. Do miss the electric light parade they had back then which was awesome. Bring it BACK! We will go back for sure 'cause it brings out the kid in EVERYONE no matter how old or young you are.
2158,2018-5,He happiest place on earth. Loved every minute of time we spent here. Be sure to use he fast pass system takes a lot of time out of waiting for rides and makes the time spent there even better. Always something to do and be sure to try and find the hidden mickeys at each ride... 
2159,2018-6,I found this park small and very dark at night? It needs more handicap accessibility. There were a lot of stairs and need Fast Passes on more rides.
2160,2018-6,"We had great moments with the kids !!!. They enjoyed every day in the games and also hunting autographs from the characters. For same games, maybe is necessary arrive early, but is not absolutely essential."
2161,2018-6,"Always great,, just long lines! even in October. plan for that especially if you have little ones. Seems as though the park was over packed. You couldn't push a stroller through the crowd and we were there a full 5 days. It was a good thing as any less time spent there you would have not been able to get on many rides.. And of course we love it there so we will be back I'm sure. "
2162,2018-6,It is so crowded even though I enter with my family at 18:00 p.m.  (The Park is closed at 21:00 p.m.).  I could play only 2 attractions.  The park is quite small compared with Disney World Orlando in which more fun.
2163,2018-6,"I went here for my 55th birthday with my oldest son, and my best friend. WHAT A BLAST WE HAD!! I was wearing my birthday button and nearly every single staff member wished my a happy birthday by name. I was overwhelmed by the end of the day. The only downside was they were closing the park at 6 pm for their Halloween party. We had to rush our visit to be sure to ride all the rides we wanted, and our favorites more than once."
2164,2018-6,"Came here as part for our Honeymoon.We only had 4 hours but enjoyed every minuteThe park is clean and well organized. We were able to do heaps in the 4 hours and enjoyed the authentic Disney shopsEven as adults, we felt like children again and cant wait to bring our 6 year old back (just not sure he would handle the 12 hour flight to get there!)"
2165,2018-6,"Everything is great as was the expectation.  At some point, visitors have to stop  going because of COST.  Its a once in a LIFE TIME experience, but they take every opportunity to make you pay for it."
2166,2018-6,"Disneyland is amazing, this park is one of the best places in the world and still the happiest place on earth, Much better than the Magic Kingdom in Orlando!"
2167,2018-6,"We visited Disneyland Park for the first time last month after being regulars at Walt Disney World for many years. Above all else, to walk in the park where Walt actually stood was a fantastic experience. There are shared rides between Walt Disney World and Disneyland Park, but also some different ones. You've got the classics, like It's A Small World and Enchanted Tiki Room and some more modern, exciting additions, such as Indiana Jones and Star Tours. All are great fun though and the theming that goes into each ride and land is fantastic. Yes, it can be busy, hot and tiring, but it's popular for a reason! Make sure to plan by looking up a strategy guide online and use the FastPass system as this can greatly improve your experience and utilise your time in the park as efficiently as possible. There is also a Disneyland Resort app, which shows you wait times, FastPass distribution times, parade times, character meet and greets and you're also able to book dining reservations.My partner and I are 29 and 30 and we had a blast! Disney isn't just for families and children, it appeals to a wide demographic, including us adults who love the magic just like anyone else!"
2168,2018-6,"Fantastic yet pricey day out. All the magic of Disney in the Original Disneyland Park. A few negatives when compare to Florida   no wifi access for guests, (services like photo pass are dependant on wifi access)   lots and lots of local pass holder guaranties lines. Skip the photopass and bring a good camera... my shots were shocking A number of attractions are currently down meaning the offer is somewhat 70% of what it should including no fireworks (kiss goodnight) but yet the price has never been higher.Positives though   Walts park, his vision and being able to see how it all began. "
2169,2018-6,"Went with my 30ish niece; we had a blast! She's a n annual pass holder and knows how to work the park. The place was packed, yet we were able to ride all the major rides. BBC e sure to f et there early and use the fastpass system."
2170,2018-6,This is our third visit to Disneyland and it is still the best. We spent 5 days here together with CAP and really gave the rides and attractions a good workout.
2171,2018-6,Hit the busy week I guess rides were 90 120 mins have not seen that ever also was a very hot week so very limited characters seemed to be outside. Didn't like that you had to pay for the Halloween party on top of spending over $500USD already to get in. Won't come this time of year again 
2172,2018-6,"Im a big Disney fan and have visited Disney World in Orlando around 17 times so i was mega excited to be visiting this one for the first time. Unfortunately our day was spoilt by the sheer amount of people that they let through the door. I choose a weekday thinking that it might be a little quieter but i was wrong. We managed to get on a few rides but most of them were 1 2 hours wait, you can imagine my husbands face!! They were having the halloween party in there on the night so i think they must let in the nighttime guests very early so mixed with the people who are already in there you just couldn't move.I was so disappointed that i didn't enjoy it more as it was my day on the holiday i was looking forward to the most. I would visit again because its Disney but maybe in low season."
2173,2018-6,Good time of year to visit as we did not have to stand in long lines. I had to see customer service about a question and they were just as nice as they could be....so pleasant to work with. The whole day was so much fun and I highly recommend it to everyone!
2174,2018-6,"Our first visit and our children really enjoyed every minute of the rides and attractions. We went on a busy day and there were some long lines. The fast pass system worked well. However, the sign for one attraction said there was a five minute line which turned into a 45 minute wait which was a little frustrating. The parade was fantastic. "
2175,2018-6,I doubt anyone says anything BAD about Disney...the happiest place on earth. I did miss seeing characters except Pluto! Where were all the princesses...and MICKEY?! And...BOTH Its a Small Word and Splash Mountain were closed...very disappointing! My favorite rides were definitely The Matterhorn and Space Mountain. 
2176,2018-6,"We love Disneyland. We were there on a very busy weekend, but got to ride most rides and shop where we wanted without too much hassle."
2177,2018-6,"Let me start by saying that my family and I love Disney and their parks. This is the second time we have traveled to Anaheim to visit Disney in the last six months from Sydney, so obviously we don't hate it. Counting Orlando, we have been to both Disney USA resorts three times in a 12 month period.The real problem is the crowds. Twice we have planned a trip for periods that by all accounts should have been a little on the quieter side, and twice we have experienced nearly full parks.It is particularly obvious that this is a  locals  park, with lots of people utilising annual passes. Sadly this turns busy parks into close to overflowing solid masses of crowds. The locals are quite happy to spend an afternoon in the park queuing for a single attraction. It is easy for them to get a return on their relatively small annual investment and obviously they do.When you are traveling from the other side of the world, it is a big investment in time and money. It just doesn't make sense to spend 90 minutes in a queue for an attraction or show when you can't simply return the following weekend.Until Disney can fix the balance in favour of the irregular visitors, we sadly won't be returning. It could be as easy as a different Fastpass system for one day   multi day visitors. Disney needs to think about making it more attractive for the visitors who will be spending a lot more in the parks to do so."
2178,2018-6,"It's unanimous, there is no slow time for Disney. We thought the lines would be shorter in October, but so did thousands of others."
2179,2018-6,"So we are very, very seasoned Disney travelers! We travel to WDW regularly, but had yet to visit Disneyland and California Adventure. So we made the trek across the country and I'm glad we did it at least once!First the biggest disappointments   we did magic hours and they only open to sections of the park   total waste of time and money! No classic Mickey Ears ice cream at either of the parks! Tried to get an ornament personalized from our trip and they don't offer it until November and no one could even give me an idea of when. Staff was not as outgoing as the WDW parks   it was just different and my husband and I noticed that most of the staff seemed to be local to Cali. I'm not saying they were rude, but they were not inclined to make anything magical. Was kind of sad! :(Things we loved! It was great showing my boys the first castle. I grew up with Disneyland and hadn't been there since I was about 16   so this was a fun trip. They loved the Matterhorn and Indiana Jones ride (both not at WDW). And they loved the usual faves that had a different twist   Haunted Mansion and Space Mountain. We overall enjoyed the visit. Happy we did it at least once!!!"
2180,2018-7,"We took our grandson (age 5) for his first time. We had a memorable time. It is more costly than I remember, but the Park Hopper tickets are worth it to be able to go between Disneyland and California Adventure."
2181,2018-7,"This was the first time going with my kids. I have a 4 year old and new born. I love Disney and everything about it but I sooo wish they would lower the max amount of people they let in each day. During magic hour is really the only time you can get any rides in if you have younger kids. I don't know any 4 year olds that are willing to wait in a 65 min line for anything. The fast passes were great but only offered on a limited amount of rides. I think they should adopt disneyworlds band fast pass system if nothing else. One other complaint is how late they were with starting the Halloween parade at the Halloween party we were at on Oct 26th. It was an hour late starting, my 4 year old fell asleep waiting for it and that was the early one and we didn't sit down until 10 mins before it was suppose to start. Couldn't imagine for the people that got there for a seat an hour before start. I always impressed by how clean they keep that park. It is amazing. "
2182,2018-7,Went on a Wednesday and it was fairly crowded. There were some long lines but luckily all the lines went fast. I would reckon It's better to get in to the park early. Also better to buy tickets n advance from Anaheim hotels or by travel agency. If you are a thrill seeker this park would not suit you. But absolutely fun time with kids.
2183,2018-7,"Although not designed for handicap access such as wheelchairs, they do their best to accommodate. I was on a scooter due to a broken ankle, and although access at California Adventure was designed for ADA, the old Disneyland park was not. In most cases, I would go to the ride exit with my family and  check in  where they would let me know how long of a wait it would be, and for me to come back at that time. It used to be they just let you in, but the ADA access rule was abused by too many for too long, so they changed the rules.... which is fair."
2184,2018-7,Be sure and get Fast Passes for popular rides.  Saves a lot of time.  Lots of good places to eat.  Entire park is very clean and family friendly.
2185,2018-7,"Go to the website, go to the Facebook page and read reviews. See where other people earned their FAIL badge and find all the tips and tricks you can. Make lists! Lists of rides you want to do, food you want to eat (make reservations at LEAST 30 days prior if needed) budget your hotel and your spending money, ASK questions ALOT and don't be satisfied with the first answer. Take your time to get the best info and the money you spend won't feel like a waste. Be flexible and learn from your mistakes  so your next trip you will feel like a PRO! We do Disney and CA once a year and learn something new each time. TIP: want to find a perfect time of year to go? Check school vacations from surrounding states like CA. NV,AZ and UT. What a surprise many people got this year when they thought they were going on a 'school day' and it turned out it was not only Yom Kippur  but LA county schools UT schools and AZ schools too a mini break on a Monday and Tuesday! BAM   full park and A LOT of pissed off people. Disney Hotel is lovely, but stay in a 'disney friendly' offsite hotel. The Best Westerns are amazing and close enough to walk to the park 9 BW plus has a free shuttle too). If you check the website, you can also see what ride will be closed and when, so you won't miss your favorite  or it won't be a 'surprise' ! Be 9 YEARS OLD again! TIP: those strollers are killers.. watch your ankles!"
2186,2018-7,"Amazing Fireworks show. Parade was typical Disney. Great value, park thinned out. Would consider going again"
2187,2018-7,"Not the same place as those in our 60's remember. Miss the simpler times. Too many characters to worry about. Forget autographs, stick to photos. And don't let Halloween party people in until 7:00, very dangerous crowd level. Give discount to those of us forced out at 7. I was surprised at how dark places were. Need more lighting. All those giant leaves in CA Disney could have LED lights on them. That would be magical. First time I didn't buy anything, but I sure did at the 50th year! "
2188,2018-7,"Although not nearly as large as Disneyworld, Disneyland offered BIG fun and we enjoyed every second of it during our 1 day visit. We especially enjoyed Carsland and all the attractions there. We waited in line for over an hour for the race car ride, but it was well worth it, and we would have done it again if we had had the time! We also really enjoyed the Nemo Submarine adventure. Very fun! We saw most of what we set out to explore in the park, and since we had a park hopper pass, we also visited Adventure Land, which is a short walk across the adjoining lot."
2189,2018-7,"Booked a southern California visitors pass, so had 3 day's to spend in Disney. Going in October the park is celebrating Halloween so have special night were guest for a little extra cost get to dress up in costumes and get to celebrate Halloween Disney style with firework shows. Great for adults and children and not at busy as Florida."
2190,2018-7,"I have been to Disneyland many times over the last 20 years so I know how it used to be. It's sad that over those visits, the experience has gotten progressively worse. Way overcrowded and expensive. Quality of food was poor. And what happened to variety? Our last visit to the Orlando park 2 years ago was disappointing and we said we would never visit Disneyland again. But we did only because we travelled half way around the world with friends who had never been before. It was embarrassing that we recommended the visit thinking it would be still be magical for first timers.We visited on a Tuesday, low season as it were. So many rides were broken down or under maintenance. Fantasmic was under maintenance (there was nothing to replace that) and there were no fireworks. Only on weekends, they said. Stood in line for Big Thunder Mountain for almost an hour and that broke down. Got a Fast Pass at 2pm to return to Space Mountain at 8pm only to have that break down as well. All they said was sorry and no idea when it would be fixed. People were angry and yelling at the staff. I felt sorry for them as it's not their fault but they handled the situation badly. Staff were clearly over worked and not happy. Parents were frustrated. Kids were impatient standing in line for hours. Happiest place on Earth? Definitely not. There used to be Disney cast around every corner but on this visit, we saw only Pluto and that was on our way out at 9pm. It wasn't Disneyland. It was a Disney themed park, at best. With lots of Disney merchandise to make up for the missing cast if anyone is interested in parting with a lot of money. This is it. Never again Disneyland."
2191,2018-7,"Nothing beats a trip to Disneyland. However, it   s a lot more expensive these days and with all the new construction going on for the new Star Wars land, you have to really keep track of what features and areas are now closed. The other problem is that it always seems crowded, especially when we go. So to get the most value for your money, you need to do a lot of homework by reading up on what is going on and what people recommend to get the most out of your visit. If you don   t put in a lot of planning, you will not enjoy your visit as all you   ll be doing is waiting in lines with a big day of frustration. You should arrive at the park as early as one hour before the scheduled opening. Note that they have early openings on certain days so unless you have a    Magic Hour    on your pass, you can   t get in with this group. However 15 minutes before opening, they will open the gates for a rope drop in the center circle around Mr. Disney statue area. Every day, they select a family to help open the gates. On all the days we were there, no minorities were selected. I think they need to make sure that the selectors are mindful of this or perhaps Disney is doing this on purpose. If you look at the lines, there are at least a good number of minorities waiting in the front of the lines as this is how they select by choosing a family in front. So why didn   t we see more minority families being selected. The re modelled Peter Pan ride seemed to be the most popular in the park with continual long lines so this is a good place to dash to (suppose to be no running) as the line builds quickly here even just after the rope drop. People were also hurrying over to Indiana Jones or Space Mountain. Keep in mind that the reason you go to Peter Pan first is that it is not on the fastpass system so it   s get there early or wait in line. While the other rides are on the fastpass system. The fastpass system is pretty good considering otherwise, it   s always wait in long lines. With fastpass, you will normally wait only up to 15 minutes and many times can just about walk on a ride in 5 minutes. Make sure you use this wisely by looking at the time the pass will be good for. If it   s too far in the future, you will now have to wait for a couple of hours before you can get another pass. While if you get one in just an hour or two, then when that time comes up, you can send a runner to get another fastpass for another ride. You don   t have to be present to get a fastpass but you must have activated your pass at a gate, either Disneyland or Disney California Adventure. Disney has it   s own smart phone app now that shows you wait times for rides. Make sure you use this as it will greatly help in planning out what you are going to do. We   ve used mousewait before and you should realize that these apps are not a hundred percent correct but will in general show you how long lines are.In October, there are days when they have special Halloween parties in the evening and therefore close Disneyland early at 6 p.m. This means everyone with hopper tickets head over to DCA. but it also means you won   t get a long day at Disneyland so make sure you are aware of hours in October or may be surprised that they are closing down. Speaking of closing, there were a lot of rides and shows closed down due to construction going on for the new Star Wars land. So make sure you look at Disney   s web site to see what is open and what is closed. All of    Bear Country    was shut down when we were there. We caught the last day of Splash Mountain and then it   s been down for quite a while now. They should really should have kept the ticket price down with all the closures but they didn   t and why should they with all the people still showing up there. Probably 20% of the park is closed for  refurbishment .So go, but make sure you plan. Expect crowds and long waits but make good use of the fastpass system."
2192,2018-7,"Look it is always busy and it is just the way it is so you deal with the crowds by getting there early and doing the fast pass or wait in line, they have things to entertain you as your waiting but I know young children do get impatient. For me I love Disney and all that goes with it so if I wait in line for 20 min extra I don't mind."
2193,2018-7,"My fiance grew up in Pasadena and has been visiting DL for well over 40 years while I'm a native Midwesterner who's only been in SoCal for six years. This was only my third time to DL but by far my best! Reasons being: we went on a weekday (Fri), we arrived before the park opened, and we planned our visit in advance (which rides to go on first since we'd be there when it first opened, where to eat, etc). It was great to have a plan rather than just winging it as I usually do when going to a place like an amusement park. Thanks to good planning and effective use of Fast Passes (a must!), we rode every ride we wanted to ride as well as a few others (monorail, Casey Jr. train), we saw every attraction we wanted to see attend, and we ate when we wanted and where we wanted while staying within our budget. Visiting really does bring out the kid in me!"
2194,2018-7,"We attended the Halloween Bash on Saturday night. It was the best Disney experience ever! The rides had short wait lines. The candy was every where!! The haunted mansion was transformed into The Nightmare Before Christmas. Space mountain was transformed into the ghoul ghost ride. Main street was decorated beautifully!!!!  The night parade was awesome. I still have the Halloween song in my head 'it's Halloween, Halloween everybody!' The fireworks and light show was great! And everyone in all their costumes, adults and kids, was just the best!!!! We loved it!!!!! "
2195,2018-7,"California Adventure out did Disneyland this time. Disneyland had a surprisingly high number of permanent & temporary Attractions down. At one point the following were all unavailable   Space Mountain (Ghost Galaxy), Splash Mountain, It's A Small World, Haunted Mansion, Mark Twain Riverboat, Autopia, Indiana Jones: understand that this was all at once. That doesn't leave many places for people to go. Lines became overwhelming and knocked Disneyland out of the Happiest Place on Earth spot. We get that rides stop for safety reasons and Disney would rather have them running than not running   but it tarnished the experience anyway. When so many rides are down, they should flood the streets with Characters but few were to be found (without huge lines). "
2196,2018-7,"I love amusement parks but hated Disneyland.It looks like the corporate greed at Disney is at its peak. We went during low season in October and it was still crowded and packed with lines averaging between 30 60 minutes per ride.Everything is overly priced, so the overall feeling is not  we want to make your kids happy , but rather  We want your money, and all of it .If you're willing to pay $100 per ticket and wait 45 minutes for a 30 60 second ride, by all means, go ahead   I will never make that mistake again.They are obviously filling the park up to it's legal limit where you feel like you are in a herd so they can maximize their profit.Highlights:  Wait in 15 minutes of traffic to pay for parking.   Pay $18 for parking followed by 15 minutes traffic to enter parking lot.  Walk 10 15 minutes more to the tram that leads to the entrance.  Wait on line for the tram 10 more minutes.  Drive another 5 minutes on a tram to the entrance.   Wait another 5 minutes on line to pass security  After passing security, even with e ticket, wait another 5 10 minutes on line to get into the park.  Once entered, squeeze between the herd of people.  Wait on 40 60 minutes lines during low season.   After leaving the park, spend another 25 30 minutes to get to the car.If Disney were to pay me $100, I would not go there again.If you have small children, you are better off paying $18 and going to Adventure Land, with lines ranging from no wait time at all to about 5 10 minute waits."
2197,2018-7,We had a great day here. Can certainly fit everything into a day.We used Fast Pass for a few rides & it worked well.We ate at Cafe New Orleans   very good meal.Only disappointment was this...and IT'S A BIG ONE.We only saw 2 characters ALL DAY. Pluto was around but only available for a short time   both times that we saw him.When we compared this to Orlando...very different.
2198,2018-7,"Fun..,.also, just recently did a review on Candy Cane Inn and forgot to punch in the rating score And I Give the Candy Cane Inn a score of Excellent."
2199,2018-7,Decided last minute to visit park and get our  Disney fix!  It was a different (and fun)  experience visiting without kids! Expected long waits going through security but the line moved quickly and efficiently! Will come back next time with kids :)
2200,2018-7,"This park opened in 1955, it was not designed to hold 80,000 people. It is out of date with old rides that constantly break down. We needed 3 attempts to ride the most modern of these, the Indiana Jones ride, because it kept having  technical issues .Many of the attractions were closed for one reason or another. You won't find this out until it's too late. For example,  its a small world  is closed for 2 weeks to get it ready for christmas??? couldn't they have waited until after the busy halloween breaks?The magic hour is a complete waste of time. They let you in an hour earlier than the general public but then only open 2 sections of the park. The queue for the Peter Pan ride was bigger than I've ever seen it for this reason. There are no longer disney characters strolling around the parks either. If they do make a fleeting appearance you will have to queue to have a photo taken and then they will be whisked away.Some areas are just too narrow to cater for the crowds and we were there off peak. In particular the narrow streets around frontier land became particularly congested.Disney California Adventure Park across the way is far superior in every way to this dilapidated old relic from the 50's. The rides and layout are good examples of a more modern architecture.I certainly won't be rushing back"
2201,2018-8,We went on a Sunday and Monday. The park was busy both days but we still got a lot done. We also went to the Halloween party which was amazing. It's divided into lands with Frontierland being my favourite. A large area of the park is sectioned off due to the expansion but don't let this put you off as there is still plenty to do.On the Sunday the longest we queued for a ride was Ghost Galaxy which was 50 minutes. On the Monday we did not queue longer than 20 minutes. We followed a plan on both days and did notice that rides we walked on had lines up to 90 minutes later in the day.As always Disney can not be faulted for it's customer service and guest interaction.
2202,2018-8,"Very pretty and well designed. Clean with lots to see, however it is very over crowded and wait times for rides are ridiculous. On two occasions we waited for an hour to then have the ride closed for maintenance! It's a shame as the rides are fantastic! I'm glad I visited Disneyland, but I wouldn't go back. "
2203,2018-8,"This was a very disappointing experience! A lot of money to stand in lines to rides, food, drinks, toilet......I didn't see kids having a good time, just waiting and getting bored. The rare appearances by the characters where short lived and left many children missing out and disappointed after standing in yet another line."
2204,2018-8,"Love Disneyland   the rides and shows are wonderful.  Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln  should be experienced by everyone as it is truly amazing. Mass influx of urban assault strollers filled with 2 3 4 year old children (who will NEVER remember the Park) really add to the crowded feeling and the hundreds of them parked outside attractions looks like a used car lot. Big numbers of electric scooters piloted by ex battleship captains adds yo not only the crowds but also impact the safety as the drivers tend to be a bit aggressive and move 4 5 MPH.Thunder Mountain Railroad makeover is really good. Food is dear, but a BBQ Turkey leg ($14.00) is a must and enough for two adults. $3.50 for a bottle of water is borderline legal extortion, but there are plenty of water fountains throughout the Park. "
2205,2018-8,By far the original is still the best is the world. However the fireworks are really disappointing people start jockeying for prime spots hours before the event only for it to over in five minutes. One night we were there the Angels had a home game with a fireworks display that last at least another five minutes longer. The staff are fantastic but there was one stand out cast member   Max. Max was marvelous we were traveling with a child in a wheelchair and Max went out of the way to ensure he had a day to remember. Thank you Max you were amazing   Elvis sends he love
2206,2018-8,Only had one day here and wished I had stayed longer.  Loved it and can't wait to go back.  Some of the rides were closed so gutted I didn't get to go on more.  Fab show at the end
2207,2018-8,"We've been to Disney world three times in the past five years so decided to give Disneyland a go this time. We went mid week in October and the resort was as busy as I've seen on a weekend at Disneyworld. The whole day was ruined as we only got on four rides and walking around was like being part of a chaotic parade, with bumping, jostling and challenges to get anywhere. Disney needs to do better and limit access to the park. Selling unlimited tickets is a terrible experience for guests and terrible value as well. "
2208,2018-8,"Good old Disneyland has gone downhill in experience and too far uphill in price. Depending on the type of ticket you purchase, the entrance cost is about $100 per day per person 10 . Then you have to pay $23 per car for parking.The really sad aspect of modern day Disneyland is the waiting time for better rides. We visited on a week day when schools were in session. We thought this would be a good time to avoid the crowds. But, the wait time for the better rides was still 1 1 2 hours per ride    far too long for a happy experience. They really need to do something about this    makes Disney experience more frustrating than fun."
2209,2018-8,Seems the lines are shorter now then years back. The park was very clean and organized. My family had the perfect time
2210,2018-8,We had a 2 day pass and only saw half the park. We will need to go back but that's ok. We loved it! It's huge and the rides are well done. The fire works were spectacular. I was disappointed that it was so hard to find a good spot for the parade though. That needs to be readdressed. For the price you pay to get in there there is no reason why you need to waste your time and go snag a seat 45 mins before the parade begins. That time could be used to check out the park. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique if you have a little girl. We also did the Halloween party. I wouldn't spend the $$ to do that again. 
2211,2018-8,"I havent' been to Disneyland in a lot of years. It was great to be back and take my kids on the classics like Matterhorn. We have been to Disney World, so focused on things that you can't do there (Matterhorn, Indiana Jones, Rogger Rabbit, walk through Sleeping Beauty Castle, etc.). Toon Town is definitely better at D land. Kids all had a blast. We had a range of ages (4yrs to 60yrs) so we split up sometimes and then everyone got to focus on what they liked best. The food is overpriced but fun treats to be had. The candy shop on main street had awesome treats  loved the cake pops in the  Book Of Life  theme  probably just for Halloween time? And the tigger tails  marshmallows covered in caramel in chocolate. Fun times!"
2212,2018-8,"If you want the classic park and attractions go there. We went both parks coz i really wanted to say goodbuy to tower of terror before they close it in Jan 2017. But i like this park better. I do think the need put more signs how to get to the cashier when you coming from the parking its really unclear for first timers, and a bit renovation want heart. The price it's definitely too high."
2213,2018-8,"First time we have been to this disney park, it was really busy, and we had to wait for at least 45 mins on every ride we went on, well all two of them, indiana jones broke down after 45 mins, so left the que, went to see the disney characters and couldnt find them, only one, and was told that we had to wait until the next time slot, my daughter was very upset, we had travelled all the way from uk. We went into the adventureland park, and the rides were two hours plus, so didnt get abything. 165 dollars to go on 2 rides, is very expensive."
2214,2018-8,This is my first visit to Disneyland. We have visited Disney World many many times. People told me I would be disappointed but I was definitely not. I liked it better than Magic Kingdom. I loved that they still had some of the old rides like Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. We loved it. I liked that the theme parks and Downtown Disney all all within walking distance. That's a definite plus for me. Takes forever to get from one to another in Disney World. 
2215,2018-8,I just got finished using a annual pass. Last yea things seem to be hoping at Disneyland. As the year has gone by I have gotten more and more disappointed. The last visit that was in October 2016 was quite disappointing. Splash mountain and that whole area was closed down. Most the rides in Disneyland had glitches and were closed on and off. The place seems a bit dirty not kept up well. And the crowds are totally out of control. They have brought out a really old parade and the fireworks were quite disappointing. I'm not renewing my pass. Over at California adventure they will be closing Tower of Terror. The parade there hasn't changed at all. Toy story ride seems dirty like they need to clean the sidewalks and umbrellas Hopefully things will get better in the next few years
2216,2018-8,"I just went here with my wife, kids and two grandchildren. I know people grouse about the price, parking and everything being so expensive but to watch the magic in my grandkids eyes was worth every dollar...it was priceless! I haven't been here in about 25 years and it's really better than ever!"
2217,2018-8,We went on a busy Saturday and without kids!!  Once we figured out the fast pass we got to see and do everything on our list!  Felt like a kid again!  Fireworks were beautiful!  We thoroughly enjoyed our visit!
2218,2018-8,We were here at Disneyland during deer Halloween festivities did you every other night the ticket is a separate ticket for me to Disneyland ticket but I highly recommend it it was fun and if you don't go to the parade almost all of the rides in Disneyland you could walk right on none of them had longer than A5 minute wait and as for the Halloween show it was incredible absolutely amazing highly recommend this to others
2219,2018-8,You just need to pick the right time of the year. We went on the 17th to the 19th and that was a big mistake. The park closes early because of Mickey's Halloween party and there were a zillion kids (and adults) in costume at the park. First fast pass given out for the day was for a ride at 4:30pm. That is ridiculous.
2220,2018-8,"We went on a Tuesday in October, not on one of their Halloween nights, thinking it would be more of an off time and less busy. Several rides had hour long waits. It was neat to see the original Disneyland, though it's no longer  Disneyland  but  Disneyland Resorts  a small change, but it irked me nonetheless. Seeing some of Walt's original rides and where he's been was something to experience at least once. The Pirate's of the Caribbean was a great ride as was the Nightmare Before Christmas themed Haunted Mansion. The food we ate when in the park was good. "
2221,2018-8,"I recently went to the two Disney parks in Anaheim after Hurricane Matthew forced me to cancel my trip to Florida, where I was planning to visit the Disneyworld parks. I found the Anaheim parks to be a disappointment compared with the Florida Disney parks. Not only is it smaller (two parks instead of 3 and 2 water parks in Florida), the offerings at each park were also less interesting.The main Disneyland park is OK and compares quite well with Magic Kingdom in Florida. But the companion California Adventure park was really disappointing, where the only ride of note is the Tower of Terror and Grizzly River Run were the only rides of note. In both parks, key rides were not working, such as the California Screamin roller coaster and Splash Mountain. For a two day ticket at $195 each, it wasn't worth it. I'm glad my partner got to see a Disney park, but I've been to the Florida parks a few times in the past, and the Anaheim parks were a poor second. The parks would be better for families with small kids, but still not a patch on the Florida parks.A final note. Disney does not allow selfie sticks. While this is understandable, I was upset that they did not indicate this when we bought the tickets, and when the security pointed this out, there was nowhere to store them (and going back to the hotel would have wasted an hour), so we were forced to throw ours away. They really need to make this more clear wherever ticket are purchased."
2222,2018-9,A little over priced to take children under height limit when you can't all ride the rides even in.disneyland.
2223,2018-9,It was my dream to go Disneyland since i was a little girl and it didn't dis point. even tho it was very busy we used the fast pass system and it worked well.
2224,2018-9,Relieve all your childhood memories and let the kid in you play.  Be early for the shortest queues and get fast passes when you can.
2225,2018-9,"We had a good day at disneyland but felt the place needs a make over, most of the rides are the same from when I was there 30 years ago. The fast pass tickets where good if you managed to get hold of them. The park closed early for Halloween Party and we were left out in the cold. At the end of the day we were left tired just like Disneyland."
2226,2018-9,"We purchased a 3 day park hopper ticket, spent 2 full days in Disneyland and 1 full day at California Adventure park . A very disappointing and frustrating time in both parks with wait times on rides in excess of 1 and 2 hours, long wait times to get pics taken with characters, fast passes all exhausted for the day before 10 am in Adventure Park, rides not operating. Yes both parks are a magically place if you just want to walk around but the hype doesn't live up to the reality if you want to experience everything on offer."
2227,2018-9,"We were a bit disappointed with Disneyland Park. Compared to Tokyo Disneyland and Euro Disney, this park lacked the magic that the other two had. The 3pm parade was a bit disappointing   it wasn't as long or as exciting as the others. We still had a great time on the rides and make sure you use the Fast Passes. "
2228,2018-9,I like the Magic Kingdom.  I don't know though that the staff have quite the enthusiasm as in years gone by.   The attitude of the people makes the whole day more worthwhile.  Still good of course.
2229,2018-9,"It's a cliche but this really is one of the happiest places on earth. From the moment you get off the bus or tram or walk down to the main entrance it begins with those familiar tunes bringing a smile to your face. The park itself is always immaculately clean and the gardens beautiful (never seen a gardener there so I guess it's all done magically ). Let's be realistic though not everything is perfect everyday (rides closed, too crowded etc.) but, and it's easy, you just ignore those things and enjoy yourself and make the most of everything. Serious gripes would be inconsiderate guests with strollers barging through and people in scooters doing the same thing. Some courtesy from these (not all) would make it an even happier place if that was possible. I experienced the Halloween Party on my last visit. It was fantastic. Less crowded with the only queues being for the Haunted mansion and Space Mountain   dark rides that I had visited during the day without the queues, go figure. The new parade and fireworks lived up to expectations. It's nice to see the villains getting centre stage for a change. A great night. Last of all a word of praise for the cast members   their friendliness and helpfulness was outstanding. Their attitude is a huge contribution to the happy atmosphere in the park. Can't wait for my next visit in 2017. "
2230,2018-9,A great place to cross of your list. Be prepared to do a lot of walking so comfortable shoes are a must. Utilise the fast pass when possible as it saves time waiting in line. There are lockers available for hire though the big ones go fast. Parades are fun and there are lots of shops that sell all kinds of goodies. Plenty of photo opportunities through out the park. Don't forget the sunscreen and have a great day.
2231,2018-9,"We were there with our family 10 13 16. It was near impossible to get on any rides and we feel like we wasted money just to walk around the park, eat horrible food and bump into other frustrated people. I know the park is for kids and sometimes you just have to deal with crowds to make them happy, but this trip was ridiculous. If they are going to sell that many tickets to get into the park they should have a way for people to track it and decide if they want to try another day.Another disappointing thing was the characters that used to be found walking around the park were nowhere to be found. This was very disappointing. We waited in lines to get pictures with the characters only to get to the front of the line in time for breaks. This added to the frustration of an already frustrating day. The lady asking for feedback in the park was given. This same information. Hopefully they can come up with some way to truly make this the happiest place on earth, because it wasn't for us."
2232,2018-9,"As a family, we've logged hundreds of days at Disney parks, and have never had a bad experience. Even when we attend while busy, the experience has still been great. That is, until Friday Oct. 21st. Disneyland closed at 7 for a trick or treating event. I noticed on their website that they were doing this, but never imagined that they would kick a full paying customer out early, but that wasn't the worst part. If you didn't have a wrist band, you couldn't even use the restrooms at the back of the park! My wife had to struggle all the way to main street to get in an insanely long line for the restroom. Then, while waiting for her, I tried to purchase some items and a beverage in a nearby shop, and was denied entrance, and told it was for wrist bands only! So let me get this straight, we pay over $300 each for park hoppers, but a trick or treating wrist band holder is more valuable? The trick or treaters weren't buying anything in the shops, but many of us wanted to at least shop since we were being excused early from riding the attractions. No dice! This is classic double dipping! Park hoppers paid full price for a day, but got kicked out 5hours early, and the trick or treaters, paid $50 for half day, I guess we'll be going to Universal or Magic mountain from now on."
2233,2018-9,"I've been to disneyworld and a lot of other parks so i knew what to expect coming in.Disneyland is more expensive than Disneyworld, but seemed to have longer wait times (i went on a sunday, so kinda expected that) Fast pass is a great idea, and i enjoyed using it in the longer lines. Meeting the characters was easy, but again..they had a lot less than disneyworld or epcot. Food was great, had the best turkey leg ive ever had for a costly price of $12. I liked this place...definitely kid friendly...but should have some kind of peak limit for overcrowding. "
2234,2018-9,"My first Disney park was the Magic Kingdom in Orlando in 1985. I was on a school trip with 60 classmates. It truly was magical and a memory I'll always hold dear. Flash forward a mere 18 months and I'd graduated and move to Southern California from my little town in Indiana. I had to experience the original Disneyland. I'd luckily been spared the comparisons that had been made by many a travel enthusiast so I wasn't there to compare one visit to the next. The magic I'd felt in Kissimmee was again ignited the moment I passed through the arches under the train tracks and entered the world of Yesterday, Fantasy and Tomorrow. It's easy to sense what it must have been like for Walt to dream up this marvel. The joy every square inch exudes is papable to both young and old. You can't help but be drawn into the mystique that the creative team has so carefully engineered in every detail. I'm lucky that with my annual pass and close proximity I can spend an hour, a day or a weekend anytime I like exploring still unseen delights. Go. Don't even think about it."
2235,2018-9,Had a great time went with family. The park was more crowded than California Adventure but we expected that since it is more popular. The lines for the rides went fast it was good to get Fastpass at several locations we had a wonderful time.
2236,2018-9,"Ok, bad experience due to wind   no fireworks and rain on the last day. I don't fully buy into the sell special event ticket thing. You buy a pass but time is limited due to special event? We bought the additional event for one day. Plenty of candy, decorations great, parade great but no fireworks due to wind. "
2237,2018-9,"Imagine months of planning and excitement all because a family of 3 is going to go to the 'magic kingdom'for the first time together.Now imagine the horror of arriving to find a park with near consistent 45 to 90 minute waits!In a nutshell: I had a 4 day park hopper and I STILL have not been on all of the rides at Disneyland and California adventure.I was told by a waiter in a local restaurant that their legal capacity is 80000. The park had to at least be approaching that mark as it was a near un sail able Sea of people. The fast passes were gone by early afternoon and in short a highly anticipated vacation turned into my wife and I just trying to navigate a park that I knew I would never be back to. My son (and all three of us) enjoyed the rides we did get onto, and if you can hit the park at a quieter time I would recommend it.But do your homework   we were there for the first week of October and found out while there that Arizona students have a funky school year and that they were on a 2 week break (I'm from Canada and wouldn't have guessed in a million years that that could be a problem). Also discouraging was that I did ask 3 different staff members at Disneyland and they said that what I was seeing is normal... I hope not, as I honestly wasn't seeing a lot of smiles on people's faces.Conclusion: I loved the rides, but I hate insane crouds. If you go during a busy time you are basically paying $1000 for the 'pleasure' of being in lineups.PSDivide their 80000 people capacity by the number of actual rides.. I doubt the math will look great."
2238,2018-9,"As ever with a Disney park you get exactly what you come to expect. Exceptional customer service, great fun for all ages and s great day out.Having been to Florida for Disney previous I knew what to expect. The park here is considerably smaller than the Orlando equivalent, but well laid out and with unique rides Orlando doesn't have it was a great day."
2239,2018-9,When you arrive you get picked up at the garage witch is about as convenient as it gets. You go through a light screening at the security point witch is good on a count of it protects both parks from nut cases haha. Once arrived you have plenty of rides to choose from depending on where you stay. I suggest getting the park hopper pass witch is amazing you get a taste of both worlds. You can use your ticket to receive fast track passes witch is convenient also they only take about one hour so you can come back and walk to the front of the line. Indiana jones and the Haunted Mansion are classics and my all time favorite. Please visit Tom Sayer island and make your way to space mountain if you can.Fireworks at night witch about sums up the happiest place on earth.10 10Please visit 
2240,2018-9,"First trip without the kids and we had so much fun. My husband wondered if we would be only adults without kids. Um, no. We met a ton of people, on the shuttle, in lines, everyone was nice and friendly. It was super hot (upper 90's) but everyone kept their cool. The longest we waited in a line was probably 45 mins. It was a bummer that the heat kept the Monorail from running, I missed that one, it's a great break and a great way to see the park. We probably enjoyed the  original  rides the most, like Small World, Teacups, but that's partly just memories for us. The Disney app is a great tool, helped us know what to hit next and when to fast pass. Sadly I never did get a Dole Whip, it was always such a long line. Don't hesitate to go as a couples only trip, it changes how you enjoy the park. The Halloween decor was beautiful too!!!"
2241,2018-9,"Disneyland is a magical experience for all ages! Space mountain and the Indiana Jones ride are awesome, and the parade and fireworks are magical!"
2242,2018-10,"Normally I would shout with joy about Disneyland. But this last trip was often miserable. We started our trip with the extra ticket Halloween party. It was fun to wear costumes. We stood in one line to see Mickey. After 10 15 minutes we tried another line but all the characters were on break and it would be an hour before returning. So no more characters for us. Trick or treating went well. We came away with 4 full bags of candy...but the lines in toon town took 30 minutes to get through. The parade and fireworks were great. I was sad to discover after booking our trip (in July) that by October there would be no nightly fireworks or night parade. No paint the night. Very upsetting. Let alone, weeks before that Critter Country including splash MTn and pooh would be closed The rest of our trip was in 99 degree heat. While many tracking sites indicated the crowds would be at level 3 4, with 20 minute waits...we often found 40 60 minute waits. Standing in the hot sun was miserable. Disney had little undercover area for lines, or parade waiting. We were miserable. Yes we took breaks back to the hotel for naps, but the parks closed early (8 or 10pm) making it difficult to get much done after sunset (when cooler). I had no problems with staff orcleanliness. Or even prices. My problem is the overcrowding, too hot...sucked the fun right out of our vacation."
2243,2018-10,"I used to come here every summer in my teens when visiting my grandparents and its been over 10 years since. I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was just as I remembered. Magical, fun and just a happy place. All the workers were so nice. The food was great, we had no problems with the fast passes we got. Despite coming during Halloween season, we didn't have to wait for rides as long as I thought. The only long wait was Space Mountain (70 minutes). Everything else was 25 40 minutes. And this was a Sunday! We got on the Matterhorn and Indiana Jones ride twice. The park isnt crazy big and easy to get around. Just be ready for crowds and carriages. The only negative was parking. We waited a half hour to park because they had one person working both sides of the booth. Unacceptable for peak season time. We were late for our breakfast reservation. But everything else was nice. Also dont wait hours for the fireworks. It is literally a 5 minute show. It's over before you can blink. I felt bad for people who camped out in front of the castle an hour before."
2244,2018-10,"I went with my daughter and son, 10 and 14 years. My daughter had n OK time for the 7 8 hours we spent at the park. My son and I thought it was terrible and a huge disappointment. They let so many people in that the lines were 45 100 minutes to all the fun rides. We managed to go on 5 not very funny rides in the six hours within the park. The rest of the time we spent getting back and forth to the parking lot, even though the shuttles ran frequently. We had two meals. No details but we finished them mostly because we were hungry. Positive:We wathed a 15 minutes show that was good fun and I liked the shapes and designs of some of the rides(the monorail and the old futuristic tomorrowland). I think I have never spent 450$ worse and I can't remember last time I wasted a day that thoroughly. Sorry."
2245,2018-10,"I have been to Disneyland Florida and Disneyland Paris and always fancied coming here as it's the original. We went on a Friday and it was really busy. Unfortunately a lot of the rides were shut, at least 7! This also meant the queues were really long for the other rides. The park itself isn't that big compared to other disneylands. It was also a very hot day and there wasn't a lot of shade when you're waiting in a queue, we actually saw one woman faint in a queue because of the heat. I did enjoy it, but I think you spend enough to go to these parks you expect most of the big rides to be open. Also, the fireworks weren't on which was massive shame! I love Disney and think it's magical but don't think I would return to this park!"
2246,2018-10,"Came here for my daughter's 1st birthday. I know she doesn't really understand yet with all the attractions, but she was so happy and really enjoyed all the kid ride. Absolutely amazing place for kids and the adult as well."
2247,2018-10,I think the fact that my husband and I have had passes for over 20 years says a lot. We have brought our kids up in Disneyland. I will say it is clean and fun. I also must add it is over priced and keeps going up. I am not sure how many more years I will keep my passes for. 
2248,2018-10,"Just returned from holiday in Los Angeles. Had three day pass for Disneyland & Disney adventure park. Better value to buy 3,4 or 5 day pass if you are there a while as these can be used over 13 days from first day of use. Be prepared to have long wait as the rides are very popular. You can get a fast pass, but only for 1 ride at a time. Very expensive inside park so take some drink with you. Try to find Target supermarket as everything is so much cheaper in them. Overall the park is very good. Would go again."
2249,2018-10,"This is the first time in many years that my husband and I went to Disneyland as a couple...or our Disney Date as we called it. While the ride lines were extremely long, on one of our days, we still had a fabulous time and we enjoyed a lovely lunch..at The Blue Bayou! Delicious food, excellent service and a relaxing fun time."
2250,2018-10,"My family of 6 had a blast! All my children, ages 2, 8, 10, & 18 loved every moment. We took advantage of the fast pass & wait time apps & never stayed in line for longer than 15 minutes. The only down fall would be that we went in October during one of the Halloween nights & the park closed early at 6pm. We didn't get to see the night parade. But it's something we knew ahead of time due to my research & planning before the trip. Still, it was an awesome experience!!"
2251,2018-10,"I always enjoy Disneyland. First visit without the family. Not as much fun solo, but still worth money. The park is always clean and staff is always friendly."
2252,2018-10,"I love Disneyland!!! I have been there 8 times from Canada over my 40 years of life. I still enjoyed it a lot, but there are things that happened this time that I just don't know if it's worth it anymore. We looked at several sights and came to the conclusion Early Oct is a great time to visit. Nice weather and not to buys. We looked at what rides were closed and decided to go and take the kids out of school. It was busy. very busy. If this is considered not busy    then my point is made for me. Long lines. Long waits. I think it has to do with so so many season passes. Almost everyone paying for meals and merchandise had a season pass card to get their discount. I understand economics. Disney just doesn't care about the experience as long as they are full. But for me, I just don't think we can do it anymore and fight with the wall to wall traffic. On top of that we made sure that splash mountain was suppose to be open .. then on day 3    we go over to that area    big sign up the area is closed. So we ask the person standing there    for how long? A month!!! We were not the only people complaining. On top of that I have never in my other 7 times experienced the high level of break downs!! Thunder mountain many times. Space mountain also. Even some of the smaller rides like Snow white was down for periods of time. With all the extra season pass money you think they could pay for some maintenance so things would stay up. A once great place is now just run to maximize profits. The experience is secondary as long as people show up. Walt .. we need you back. This place has lost it's way."
2253,2018-10,"First off, I'm a huge Disneyland fanatic. I live out of state and only have managed to go about 9xs (not enough!). However, this trip Oct 9 Oct 11 was one of the least pleasant visits we ever had. We have been to DL on 3 major holidays and we never have seen it as packed as we did during this visit. I mean shoulder to shoulder crowds, 20 min to get from New Orleans to Frontierland, can't put your kid down without him getting stepped on, packed! All rides were 45 min to over 2 hours wait. Fastpasses were gone by 12pm. We went about 45 min before the park opened at 8am and we didn't get in until 10am! Parking was a nightmare as well as the security checkpoint. I heard that since DL has made annual passes more accessible, the crowds have been too difficult to deal with. And I feel this takes away from the whole magic of the park. We spend thousands of dollars to go wait in line for over an hour for a ride, 20 min for a churro, what kid wants to do that? We couldn't ride the Tower of Terror for the last time due to only one elevator running and the over 2 hour wait (no fast passes). Radiator Springs racers also had a 2 hour wait but we beelined one morning and made it with only a 20 min wait. Don't even go into Tomorrowland, you can't push a stroller through. It makes you wonder what would happen in a disaster, how many people would get stomped on? Now the good... DL sure treats you right. We were 2 hours late to our Character dining at the Plaza Inn with Minnie (security lines) and they still managed to squeeze us in. Also, the travel agency we used didn't send the e voucher on time and DL gave us 4 complementary 1 day park hoppers no questions asked! Amazing! (we resolved the problem later) Let's talk about World of Color. That show made the entire trip worth it! It was so amazing I even got emotional watching it. We got fast passes when we did that beeline to Radiator Springs Racers and they are so worth it since you watch from the front row. This is a must see in your life. Mickeys Soundsational Parade was also amazing and a nice break from the hectic day. My toddler fell for Tiana! Another thing we noticed is that there were characters everywhere and at all times. We had never seen this before. Out of the 9 previous visits we had never ever seen Mickey Mouse. We saw him 4 times! And finally Radiator Springs. Oh my goodness! It's a trip straight into the movie! Very well done Disney! 5 stars for Cars Land! Oh we also noticed that food in CA Adventures is significantly cheaper than DL. Plus they have alcohol (Rita's Margaritas anyone?) We enjoyed our time at CA Adventures more than DL in the end. I hope DL fixes this crowed mess, I doubt it since they are rolling in the dough. "
2254,2018-10,"Disneyland needs to get  Magic Bands !!!! Magic Kingdom in Disney World is so much better because of Magic Bands. It is very difficult to get fast passes, and when the park is crowded the lines are very long. Unfortunately, the walkways are tight, and when there are crowds, it is difficult to navigate here."
2255,2018-10,"Visited the park on 10 17. There was a bit of rain during the early morning and thought that there won't be as much people because of the weather. But boy was I wrong, got there at around 9 am and the park was crowded. The attractions have lines but we didn't wait longer than 30 minutes on most of them. I only wish that the fee was more affordable. It just keeps going up and up. :("
2256,2018-10,8 years and it just gets better and beter.  STAR WARS land is coming and will be an instant hit.  Never tire of coming here.  Great fun
2257,2018-10,"First off   thank you for prohibiting selfie sticks; next on the prohibition list   double wide strollers   PLEASE. While Disney Land and California Adventure have truly been wonderful places to experience over the years, the crowds are getting out of control. After saving up enough $$$ for three years, we were blessed to visit for 3 days during the middle of the week (non holiday time) and found that waiting 30 min to purchase a $10 Corn Dog; and 1   1.5 hours per ride line (even with FastPass) to be a little overwhelming and severely diminishes the Park experience for adults and more importantly the children. Disney has generally had relatively long lines, but even during this visit, I verbally heard on more than 3 occasions from Park employees they were have difficulty with crowd control. I realize the happiest place on earth needs to turn a profit, but I believe the crowds are getting to be a public health and safety issue. Something needs to be done."
2258,2018-10,We enjoyed the park. It was PACKED. But overall it was a fun day and we enjoyed catching all the rides we used to love and checking out some new ones. It was October so it was decked out for Halloween which was cool. Overall enjoyed the day. Why are their churros so good!?!?! Better than any other place I've had them. 
2259,2018-10,Loved it. What can I add more that is not already not known! 1. Take food with you because the walking and standing in lines can make you unimaginably hungry. 2. Carry plenty of water bottles.3. you can park your stroller almost anywhere along the park so take a big good one and not the umbrella strollers so that you can carry stuff in it. 
2260,2018-10,"Maybe it was because I was by myself. Or because I was in town for work, but Disneyland was just  meh. It's not even in the same galaxy as Disney World. The people at the gates were borderline rude. I bought a park hopper pass and when going from California Adventure to Disneyland the attendant yelled at me for not getting my hand stamped while leaving the other park.  How do I know you were there?  She asked. After showing photographic evidence from my phone that I was she let me in. I didn't mind the crowd or the lines, but the whole atmosphere was nothing like WDW. WDW is about the total package. Never have I seen litter there and every interaction with a cast member was pleasant. At Disneyland the signs even refer to the people as crew members, which I think really changes their mindset. It just wasn't the same. Apart from the difference between WDW and Disneyland the rides were fun. Even those the are the  same  rides have some fun differences. I enjoyed my time but I wouldn't travel here just to visit Disneyland."
2261,2018-10,"My 4th time to Disneyland. It was a special trip of underprivileged kids, and sick kids that were able to experience Disneyland for a day. I was a chaperone. I love Disneyland, always have and likely always will. They know how to move people and deal with people. Happy times! The looks on the 120 kids faces was worth the whole thing! Left at 5 am from Canada. Back at midnight. No regrets. "
2262,2018-11,"We were staying 30 minutes away for a conference, and decided to check out Disneyland since it was so close. They say October is the off season, but it is still crowded!! A lot of the rides we wanted to ride were down for maintenance, so it was pretty disappointing. Space Mountain was decked out for Halloween, and was by far my fave ride. It was interesting to see the differences between the same rides offered at DisneyWorld and Disneyland. We did not get the park hopper pass to include California Adventure... kind of wish we would have just gone in to that park over Disneyland... newer rides and alcoholic beverages. At least I can check Disneyland (the original) off my bucket list. I highly prefer DisneyWorld, hands down!! "
2263,2018-11,"In the area for a work event, I had to make a stop at Disneyland. I love Disney and was apprehensive at first about going by myself, but it was a great experience!"
2264,2018-11,"We went on a weekday, but the crowd was overwhelming! (See crowd behind statue in picture) Crowd control only applied in the afternoon, where they implemented one way traffic control. Selfie stick was not allowed into the park, which is understandable. But there neither lockers outside to store it, nor they let u leave it at the office, which is quite lousy customer service.. :(Rides are generally less impressive than Universal, & as per all theme parks, souvenirs are at exorbitant prices."
2265,2018-11,"I have been going to Disneyland all my life. True, it can be crowded. But the magic goes beyond the rides. We live in an instant gratification society, where people run from one ride to the next. But in the process they miss the park. Much like children running around playground equipment but miss the beauty and magic of the park itself. I understand not wanting to stand in a long line with the heat blazing on you. However, many of the lines are designed to bring the magic. One evening I was standing 40 minutes for Alice in Wonderland. Yes, it is only a three and a half minute ride. But the ride would not be the same, had it not been for the line. The design of the lighting that weaved it's way through the line was part of taking you into the story. The intimate colorful lighting that hung over the teacups just across from you and the perfect light filled trees above you, gave you a special feeling. But only if you relax.  The point of the journey is not to arrive.  Take in all the park. Enjoy the lines and your friends and family. ( Hats, sunglasses, sunscreen  necessary at times). But it is not all bad like some complain. Have your own strategy with fast passes, shows, and rides. Conserve energy by not running between both parks every hour. Listen to the music around you. Feel the magic. Do not view the rides as a simple task check list. If you understand this, you have captured the magic of Disney, and your children will see and appreciate this as well."
2266,2018-11,We were VERY disappointed in the Scary Halloween party parade.  It was not even half of the one a Disney World.  The fireworks were great though.
2267,2018-11,"If you have been to Disney World, you will be disappointed with the Disneyland. Long lines to even get in to the park and we went on weekday. Every ride was 1 hour or more wait. They jamb to many people into a very small park. "
2268,2018-11,"For your first time visit ask for a badge or if it's a special occasion you cm get a badge for free. The staff in the park truly love their jobs as they make the experience for children very magical. Depending on your visit, the park can be either busy or not. We were holifaying at the end of the Australian school holidays however it was holiday time for other US states so the park was quite busy. I would maximize your time by breaking up the park in sections especially if you have young children   that way you can really see the park. If your planning to do any character breakfasts or the bibbidi bobbidi boutique or resturants with the best view for world of colour   book in advance As that's what we did and we noticed closer to our visit That these activities had already been fully booked. Create n account on the disneyland website and you can pre book. We were also there during the Disney Halloween parties and it was fantastic! Again book and pay before you travel as Disney Halloween parties sell out. There are a lot of food options but expect to wait if the park is very busy. Best tip is to have someone in your party get the fast passes for the rides upon entry and if you have a magic morning ticket during your stay  Definately do it. The beignets which are a French pastry and shaped as Mickey Mouse are awesome but popular so expect a wait. Located near the haunted mansion ride. Also there is a great icecream near the adventure area. The parade is awesome and Definately with watching. Prams are about 15.00 to hire per day or you can hire longer term. There is city strollers that come to hotels if that's an easier option. Ask your concierge. We just bought a cheap pram from Walmart. The Disney shops are amazing with a lot of variety for gifts. Mickey ears or the headbands start around 17.00 US dollars."
2269,2018-11,"Even though we were there on an  Off Weekend , there were probably too many people because of the  Halloween  Scenery."
2270,2018-11,"Don't forget to pack your patience, Disneyland is fun , rides are fun and the staff is exceptional. What you realize about Disneyland is that people are rude, lots of strollers and hyper stimulated kids being yelled at by stressed out parents. Just go with the flow. You won't see it all in one day so enjoy what you can. Everything is super expensive and beware if days the park closes early. "
2271,2018-11,"I'm an Aussie girl who loves Disneyland. I did the Friday 14 Oct MHP with a friend and it was amazing   walk on to rides , great characters , parade , fireworks and Treat trails . The Sat and Sunday I was solo   it was busy but I hit the parks early and that's the trick   I love the food there and cast members are super friendly   can't wait until I return next Oct !!"
2272,2018-11,"I was fortunate enough to work in the Park from 1964 to 1967 while attending Long Beach State (as it was called back then) and it has been a long time since I revisited the Park. As soon as I walked onto Main St. I could feel the essence and magic that Walt so well imagined and created. There is expansion work going on in Adventureland and that disappointing to me because the Mark Twain was tied to the sock, Tom Sawyers Island was closed and the rafts weren't operating. Same for the Keel boats and canoes. One observation we both had ( another ex  Cast Member and I) was that in our opinions the overall quality of the current employees wasn't at the same level as we believed it was during our time there. There are several reasons why that could be, such as a trimmer, healthier generation back then or maybe there are  cooler  jobs to be had now but whatever the reason, it was disappointing to observe. On a positive note, the Park is still very well maintained and very clean. I loved being back!"
2273,2018-11,"I come to Disneyland because it's a tradition. I can't say that I'm overall enthralled with a park. I tend to view Disneyland as a siphon mechanism for the pocketbook with hundreds if not thousands of screaming children and Ill mannered parents pushing and shoving through lines.Disneyland today is nothing near what it was over 30 years ago when I was a kid. I like the original Disney characters and not necessarily the addition of all of the movie acquisition themes (star wars, indy jones, etc)A ticket is now at least 100.00 each. Food will cost you dearly. And if you carefully observe the people who work there, very few of them really smile anymore. Getting through the lines and crowds is at times overwhelming and stressful. On the weekend and it's not uncommon to wait over an hour for a ride. So during a 12 hour day, you may actually get to ride eight or nine right if they are popular.That being said, it's still Disney. The kids love it so it is the point of termination at least once a year. Don't get me wrong, the rides are still fun. Space Mountain and the Matterhorn are still as fun as they were when I was a kid. I guess I miss the classic Disneyland. It's worth a visit at least once in your life."
2274,2018-11,"Let's face it, they do everything well. As adults, still found lots of rides to enjoy. You have to do some study before your visit to know how the fastpass works etc. Have to wait for everything because of the crowds!"
2275,2018-11,"I would normally give this an excellent rating, but the park seems to have changed its Matterhorn ride to make the monster at the end much more scarier than I remember it. Our 5 year old granddaughter came off the ride crying. That was the end of Tomorrowland for us. Fantasyland was wonderful. Meeting her favorite cartoon characters was great and she and her 3 year old sister loved it. We didn't have time for Adventureland, which we would have loved, because we found out   after paying exorbitant prices for the park   that they were closing early for the Mickey Mouse Halloween party at 6 PM. So we were kicked out of the park earlier than expected. I don't remember seeing this proviso on the internet when I bought the tickets, either. Very disappointing. We only had the one day and wanted to make the most of it, and couldn't."
2276,2018-11,"This was our first visit to Disneyland. My wife and I took two of our grand kids, ages four and five. They had a blast, as did we. Yes, it is quite expensive, but we expected that. We spent 4 days in the park and were all exhausted by days end. The kids rode every ride that they could in the four days. We were under the impression that it would be less busy by October, yet it still seemed very busy to us. The line ups to get into attractions and on rides were, at times, very long. The kids didn't seem to mind for the most part.I think we most enjoyed seeing a couple of the shows, Frozen and Mickeys Magic Map, both excellent. Great performers. My wife had booked two appointments for the girls before we left to the Bibidy Bobidy Boo Salon, where they turned the girls into princesses with their hair and make up. The ladies were so good with the kids, and do excellent work. Well worth the money to see the looks on their faces when they are transformed. We look forward to another visit one day with our other grand kids."
2277,2018-11,Always a great time to be in Disneyland...so many things to do or just sit and people watch! Crowded at times during peak holidays.
2278,2018-11,"Am sure everything that can be said has already been said about Disneyland. Fun rides, big crowds, long lines but all work to give you the Disneyland experience. Kids love it, parents and grandparents love the way the little ones enjoy themselves"
2279,2018-11,"I fulfilled a 60 year lifelong ambition and was not disappointed in the slightest. My wife now has a real lever over me to get me to do things. No MORE Disney, and that is from Australia. I cannot wait to go back, I was slightly sceptical that I could fill 2 days but could have easily again. Allow PLENTY of time to soak up the atmosphere of the ORIGINAL and still the BEST"
2280,2018-11,"Our first visit back in quite a while and of course we love it but the charm level goes down with the large crowds we experienced. For example: 45 minute wait for Pirates, 90 minute wait for Haunted Mansion, 40 50 minute wait for several Fantasyland attractions (Alice, Peter Pan, Dumbo) 30 minutes for Small World   YIKES. Of course no one likes a whiner about Disneyland and I'm not actually complaining about the wait times, but rather the 'magic' level gets lower when it's so dense. It becomes about crowd control & management for the Cast Members and they can't sprinkle the pixie dust as well when they are trying to keep people from getting run over by strollers or people walking in every direction ; )It seems like when it gets very crowded, there aren't the pop up characters or other bits of special 'magic' that make it such a wonderful pleasure to be at Disneyland.Maybe with all the Rivers of America attractions, The Critter Country and Disneyland RR closed, it condenses people even more but it was very hard to walk from place to place. We've been right before Christmas and this wasn't that bad but it was surprisingly crowded for mid October.Of course, we'll be back another time and probably many after that : )"
2281,2018-11,It is one of the happiest place on earth. It is so special to go on a day of celebration. All the employees congratulated us as we walked threw the park. Several asked us questions about celebrating 44 years.
2282,2018-12,There are so many people here now that it is almost not fun anymore. Some of the lines are 120 minutes. Thats 2 hours waiting in a line for a 5 minute ride. There is a lot of construction going on right now so a few of the attraction are closed down.
2283,2018-12,"Disneyland is the Happiest Place on Earth and not the huge walk until you drop of the Epcot Center. However, being a local has its advantages. First, summers are packed, hot and not as much fun. Likewise holidays. So try to plan around a less known holiday or just make it a three day weekend and drag the kids out of school and have a good time. Second, bring some water and snacks with you. Disneyland inspects bags but will let water and snacks come in so you don't have starving kids crying for overpriced water or food all day long. You will also keep the kids off a sugar high! If you know a local and they are coming, Disneyland often offers cheaper rates for locals buying tickets and they can buy them for you. They check your zip code on your drivers license. Don't buy tickets in advance unless you can decide on the date of use. Yes, it does rain in Southern California and you might have a miserable time if it does. Likewise if the Santa Ana winds are blowing at 40 mph you might not want to be in the park. Check local weather reports for high wind advisories as the temperatures will sore when the Santa Ana's are blowing. Finally, remember to wear sun screen as you will be in the sun for most of the day and who wants to ruin a great time with a sunburn? Have fun!"
2284,2018-12,Watch out for strollers!  Many guests use them as weapons and block off major areas for parade and fireworks viewing.  The park was more fun and manageable during the Halloween Party!  Definitely worth the ticket!
2285,2018-12,"My special needs son wanted to come to Disneyland to celebrate his 40th birthday, and it was indeed his best birthday everDisney had his name on the marquee  Happy 40th birthday Nathan  and every time a cast member or employee saw him, they would say  happy birthday!  He got autographs and pictures, cake at The Plaza, and an offer to come work at Disneyland!! We cannot thank Steve, Lisa, and all the characters enough, for making Nathan's birthday so special      Disneyland is indeed the happiest place on earth!!"
2286,2018-12,"While this October week was the busiest that we have ever encountered, we were able to make our way through the park and rides at our usual pace. We were very disappointed that Splash Mountain, The Pooh Ride, and the Train were all closed. Those are some of our favorite things as Disneyland. It kind of made Pirates and The Haunted Mansion very crowded since that is all that is over there. But any day at a Disney Park is better than being anyplace else! We love all Disney Parks in the USA!"
2287,2018-12,"Growing up, I went to Disneyland occasionally. Getting on a ride or even around the park was a doable experience. Not anymore. This place is so incredibly packed now on a daily basis. Literally shoulder to shoulder with everyone in the park. And expect a 2 hour wait for a decent ride. And the rides only lasts seconds. Very expensive, from parking, to tickets, to souvenirs and dining."
2288,2018-12,This was my 2nd trip to Disneyland with my 4 grandkids. It went so much better this year because my daughter in law was really organized. Little snack bags for while waiting in line. Nap in the room. I used the mousewait app and it was more accurate than the time on the sign at the ride but next time I would use the Disneyland app for the ability to track characters in real time and for the awesome photopass where I could link the pictures taken in the park to the app. This means I did not have to wait in line at the photo shop before leaving. It was very easy. We did the $39 for all pictures in one day. If we had known about the app earlier we would have done the $69 for all week of pictures.
2289,2018-12,We had a great experience here we had 2 kiddos who have Down syndrome and the employees and characters were stopping g to give high fives and asking them all about there time at Disney. Amazing time with the kids
2290,2018-12,Not worth the cost of the ticket. You pay full price if you visit the park during the day but have to leave by 6 pm. Then pay another $89 to stay the rest of the evening. Furthermore Disney allows those who purchase the Halloween party tickets to come into the park beginning at 3 pm so the park has 2x the guests during the overlap. The halloween parade at night is quite dark and not nearly as good as the electrical parade. You will wait in long trick or treat lines to get candy that is nothing you couldn't get in a fraction of the time in your neighborhood. This is nothing but a money making scheme by Disney at the expense of its guests. 
2291,2018-12,"As annual pass holders we go every few months, there's something about that place that can put a huge smile on my entire families face and make me feel like a kid again."
2292,2018-12,"Had a great time on a girls trip. Always love going around Halloween , love the decorations. However, I was not impressed with getting told we had to leave park early on a Friday night due to Mickeys Not So Scary Halloween event. We were excited to see the fireworks, but we're unable to because of the event. We paid full admission only to be kicked out 5 hours early! I love Disneyland, but will not be back during the holiday seasons. "
2293,2018-12,It may cost money and you will spend money  but it is memories you make  you can never replace my child is 24 now and still talks about going as a child!
2294,2018-12,"We walked over 10 miles in one day! Use the Disneyland app to see wait times on rides   it also shows if rides are down. Haunted mansion wend down after waiting 45 min in line. Used fast pass on Indiana Jones only to have it go down as we were about to get on. Churros are expensive but delicious. Also, a must have is a mint julep   lime, mint with cherries yum! Astro Blasters was fun but lines were long everywhere. Not sure when a good time to visit is."
2295,2018-12,At least before the large crowds morph into ginormous crowds at some stage around mid morning. So much fun.
2296,2018-12,"We saved Disneyland till the end of our time in the US as a treat for the kids. Never did we expect to be caught up in the magic. Bring snacks to save a bit of money, wear your sneakers and do a bit of research before you come. So many people did not understand or take advantage of the fast pass system. It is FREE. You can hold one per park at a time and I can't think of a reason why anyone would line up for a fast pass ride without a fast pass. It takes a bit of planning but utilising fast pass and the park hopper pass, we rode every ride and saw every show over our five days including many double ups on our favourites including California screamin, Buzz and the incredibly impressive soarin over the world. Seriously, everyone applauded each time. "
2297,2018-12,"We love Disneyland. We have been a couple times before in October and were surprised at how crowded it was for this time of year. Mickey's Halloween Party at night (every night sold out) probably affected this, but it was even crowded on the no party days. To get the most out of your time, buy the Unofficial Guide to Disneyland book. We also found the Disneyland app to be helpful in checking wait times. Arrive at the park at LEAST 30 minutes before official opening. Oh and one more thing  if you take a backpack or purse on Indiana Jones, be sure to put your leg through the strap. Our backpack went flying out on the first turn; fortunately, it survived and the cast members were able to spot and retrieve it for us later in the day. "
2298,2018-12,"Well this will be our 3 trip to California Disney park and our last , It so not worth the money , to many grown adults with NO CHILDREN wait for kids rides ! Why does grown adults of 30 plus years want to got on the tea cups or dumbo rides ... ? Or worst still que to meet Micky mouse! They make the que lengths even longer, it hard enough keeping toddles in check without having to wait for 40 mins or more for rides and to meet characters . I feel that a lot of the rides are out dated and modernisation of a lot of them is well over due ,Disney is def look old and tired, come on Disney An overhaul is well over due "
2299,2018-12,Exhausting but exciting. Spent 3 days with young children and 2 days just adults. World of water was amazing. Tower of terror as gd as we remembered. Fireworks great.
2300,2018-12,"We did the Disney Halloween experience! It was great, with great decorations for Halloween, trick or treats were throughout the park for your fill of candy. They also provided sliced apples and carrots along with the other candies! It was also nice not to have as long lines as during the day for the rides. Real cute parade, also."
2301,2018-12,"Got a 5 day park hopper (only one park per day though). Only thing is, there are no fast passes for some of the rides that we wanted to ride, i.e. Matterhorn and Pirates and so on. My original thought was to do a couple of  lands  per day, but with the fast passes, we had to go back and forth between the  lands  and had that much more walking to do. Quite exhausting and the crowds were a bit much. We rented a scooter each day that my spouse and I alternated use of, even with the scooter we ended up having to do too much walking. Prices for everything were too high. Otherwise, the staff and even the visitors were very pleasant. Even waiting in lines for everything, scooter, security, access to parks, rides, characters, food.... a line for everything!"
2302,2018-12,"We were here for four days last week, and this park was unbelievably crowded. They should limit the number of people who can come in each day...but then their bottom line would not be as lucrative. When you come into the park paying the ticket prices they ask, and then can only go on 5 or so things in a day (after waiting in very LONG lines), this is not a good experience. We would leave midday and went back in later, but you still couldn't even walk down Main Street due to all the people. The lines for food was just as crazy. Even pulling a Fast Pass doesn't help with the long lines. Disney is big business, and the popularity of all things Disney just feeds the madness. This is not the Disneyland of the past. They just make it so that you need to go with their hotels and high priced events if you wnat to have an advantage. This is probably our last trip here, and I would recommend all families to really think twice about the value you get for your money."
2303,2019-1,By having the Disneyland app we were able to tell where the characters would be and what time and also times of parades events. It also told you the wait times of each ride So very helpful it made r trip with 2 little kids much easier. Also the fast passes made it fesiable to get on the big rides with hardly any wait at all. Its a must...Another gr8 advice was to get your fast pass tickets for the  cars ride first thing in the AM They sell out quickly for the day and even the line for the fast pass tickets are very long. We were going on that ride no matter what but it took thinking ahead. Many people complain about the cost of Disney and it certain adds up but the value on what u get is incrediable. If you were to buy tickets to just one of the shows like  frozen   it would cost a arm and a leg Where I live the seats we had would of been about 200 a piece...I will not ever be the one to complain about the high price of Disney Love love it The one thing I was surprised at is the restaurants get huge lines around dinner time So with little kids they get hungray and don't want to wait. It worked better to eat early and snack later if needed. We watched the world of color light show its a must see get fast tickets early and wait for the show...two of us left and walked to the giradeli store and brought back yummy hard ice cream cones and sundaes and ate while waiting for the show. They block entry off but they will let u out and back in if u talk to them..People were eyeing r ice cream for sure....
2304,2019-1,"I have been to Disneyland many, many times in my 46 years. This last trip will probably be my last. I did enjoy spending quality time with my family, who are now past the  child  stages. Thank god because to be perfectly honest, nearly every child I saw looked beat down and a huge amount of them were having major meltdowns and crying. Disneyland used to mean fun rides, fantasy characters that you could meet, junk food! Now it's theree line just to get in the gate. A line to take a picture in front of Main Street, lines to meet any character, waits over 1 hour for most rides. Children just do NOT enjoy that. They do not have the patience to endure all the standing around. Disney I am sure is much more profitable packing them in to capacity, but they must consider the experience of the folks forking over big bucks. Nobody wants to see their child cry for hours on vacation. It needs to change! I left there sad for all the parents of little ones. Not the same experience I had when mine were little."
2305,2019-1,We decided to go for the night visit to Disneyland as The Halloween special openings were on. The park is really nice and the decoration and organisation was first class. We had a great night and was well worth the money.We have visited the sister park many times in Florida and was our first visit in California and the Disney Magic is live and well. Great to visit the park and thanks to all the staff for a great night and the wonderful trick or treat lines. The fireworks were great and was amazed to see so many people participating in the Halloween theme.
2306,2019-1,"Most disappointed that our two little ones were so badly served at Disneyland. Waiting in line for 45 mins for the Dumbo ride not fun, and over in a flash. Waits for the toilet and to eat in a restuarant added to the woe. By the time we had worked out that fast passes could be issued for some rides, it was too late, they had finished. All in all, bad value for our particular family group. We heard people say it was exceptionally busy yesterday. We had travelled from UK with our grown up children and 2 grandchildren aged 2, and thought we'd treat our family to a magical day. It did not live up to expectations at all."
2307,2019-1,"What can I say? Its disneyland. Its overpriced, but worth the money. They pull out all the stops and put on amazing shows. My kids did jedi training, which was an awesome show for everyone involved. The only downside is that, when I went there as a teenager and a kid, the characters walked around more. Now you have to wait in ridiculously long lines to spend 20 seconds with them, which is disappointing. The park was packed (is it ever not?) but we had a great time. Will definitely go back. "
2308,2019-1,"Always delivers!! Nothing like a great day of lighthearted fun at Disney. Always consistent from entertainment to service to food at the parks as well as rides. Love all the rides but It's a Small World and Pirates of the Caribbean are favorites. The parade is awesome, the Disney Band performances and cool Halloween decor. "
2309,2019-1,Lots of walking...grab scooter we did. As usual long lines to see stuff. Get Fastpass life will be easier. Expect 3 days to see all. Some areas were closed...renos for Star Trek. Cart Food Hot dogs mostly. Grab map and bilingual Info folder.
2310,2019-1,Disneyland is my favorite vacation but it's way to busy in October. A friend I was with during this trip said it was busier than their summer visit! Lots of rides closed down for temporary repair when had waited in line for 1  hrs. Very frustrating!
2311,2019-1,"Disneyland was nightmarishly busy today and I don't mean that in a cutesy Halloween way. It was packed. Hard to even move packed. Even though it was crazy, we still had a great time. The Halloween decorations were spooky and fun. We got to snap a few pics with Jack & Sally which was a first for us. Fun day overall. "
2312,2019-1,"The park is always clean, details are crisp, rides are family friendly with activities for all, and the service is always excellent. In all my visits, I've only ever encountered a service problem once, and that was really a hotel tram shuttle issue. I like having a wonderful time with my family, all the while being treated like a wanted and appreciated guest at their park. It makes the experience all the more enjoyable every time! I highly recommend at least 2 3 day hopper passes, so you can relax, and not rush. 2 days is minimum to really get the full experience. Just FYI"
2313,2019-1,"So you have to re live your first Disney trip and take the kids and grand kids... maybe not at Disneyland .Park entrance was reasonably quick and security fast but thorough.Sidney staff and cast are impeccably trained..park clean etc.Amazed at lack of things happening in tune town.. few characters , everything is tuned to sell Disney crisp at very very high prices.38 dollar lunch for 2 adults one child pizza and hamburger .. and drinks wow.. park admission for 4 adults 1 3 year old .. 2 days $950 bucksTo be rewarded with a slow season wait of 49 minutes for Dumbo ride is rewarded with 1minute 30 second ride.. Get there very early ... the crowd by noon is stifling .. plus a number of creepy adult people in full dress as a characters .. no kids.Also during Halloween the through everyone out on certain nights at 7 pm to have a Halloween party that costs and extra $ 80 bucks each but was sold out.. yet we paid full price for daily ticket .. come on on Disney really . Rebate time.Sorry we only bought two days as Disneyland and not park hopper.. did not think a three year old you'll enjoy the more aggressive rides at Disney adventure park..Also small world ride and event was thrown up quickly with old technology many years ago and is just a bit tired... up grade this one event with modern technology and good acoustics please .. it's really pretty crappy. And could draw praise for great Pixar creativity..Any one ever notice the blackest of the dark skinned folks in small world are a mere tan to light brown.. people of diverse cultures are supposed to feel welcomed there and it is clear that tan people are ok but not people with very black skin ..Not so much"
2314,2019-1,"Too many people, Way too expensive, poor service, and no chance of actually seeing all there is to do, Disney should reevaluate their reasons for having these parks, yes it about money, but surely value for money should be looked at there is no way this place is memorable to children as most cannot get near any of the shows as there are just too many people allowed in at any one time, for more read my review on the California section of Disney unless you upgrade to Vip status don't go you are wasting your money and your children will be disappointed."
2315,2019-1,We decided to try out Disneyland since we usually go to Disney World. It was very fun! Park was clean and we loved the short lines for the rides (being off season). We loved the Haunted Mansion Holiday overlay and Space Mountain Ghost Galaxy. The park was decorated so nice for Halloween. It's fun to ride the different rides between WDW and DL. We also love Matterhorn. We did Mickey's Halloween Party while we were there and we really enjoyed it. We loved the trick or treating and the parade. It was a blast and we would do the party again! We will definitely come back to Disneyland! 
2316,2019-1,"The park was pretty busy as usual, but after 6pm.. the halloween experience was awesome! There are so many great stations and villains for picture taking. The fireworks are crazy good and the parade was cool! Who doesn't want to see a headless horseman? I'd go back for sure!!"
2317,2019-1,"Disney Inc needs to seriously limit the number of guests into their parks. TOO many people and so MANY strollers. The waiting times for most rides were at least 30 minutes or longer. That's a ridiculously long time for a 1 to 2 minute ride.It's a FUN place with great things to do, but TOO CROWDED!"
2318,2019-1,"Can you really expect anything other than pure magic at Disneyland?! Myself and my husband came here as part of our honeymoon trip and loved every minute! I have been to both Orlando and Paris previously and each park has just as much margin as the next! Sadly we didn't get to see the fireworks as they were only available to Halloween Party ticket holders but we went to see the Lights show in Californian Adventures instead which was spectacular.This is a day that can be enjoyed by all, just make sure you wear comfy shoes!"
2319,2019-1,"We dropped our bags at hotle & went straight to the park. Long queue to get through security checks, but it was Saturday. The park was great, we went twice during the day during our stay and also for the Halloween Special evening. The parade was a little disappointing  not as many characters or as long as the Florida version, but still had a good time."
2320,2019-1,"I arrived a day early before a conference to visit Disneyland as I had never been before. It is typical Disney, great for families with small children but slightly lacking in enough options for older kids and adults. I was surprised by how much smaller it is compared to the Florida park. Two days would be enough to visit this and California Adventure if you spend full days at the park. I was disappointed that several attractions were shut down as this will likely be my only visit. I had the park hopper, but would say it is fine to do without and just spend all day in one park each day."
2321,2019-2,"It was my first visit since my teenage years with my friends at Disneyland. This time, I brought my 4 year old son to visit. He didn't really enjoy it in the beginning, because it was so crowded on a Sunday morning and also the hot weather. Nevertheless, we spent our day at the park and was able to rack up 6 rides. It was more than I expected. The lines were very long, but some rides offered fast pass which was awesome. I was longing for this visit and we made it. We had fun at the end."
2322,2019-2,"I came here as a child in 1987, and and my wife and I decided to bring our 8 year old niece on a trip from Minnesota to Disneyland. Since we could only be here one day, we purchased single day passes which were about $95 for adults and $85 for her. Parking is an additional $18 in the massive ramp, from where you are shuttled to the main gate. After standing in line nearly 40 minutes just to purchase tickets, we were finally in the park. We picked up a map and planned our route, first stopping at Space Mountain. The line there allegedly was 40 minutes long, but we waited about 70 minutes to get on the ride. There is a handy app you can get on your smartphone that lists wait times for many of the rides, so you can plan your attack accordingly. We found that the wait times for the major rides all underestimated by at least 15 minutes.Food is very expensive, as it is at all tourist traps. Hot dogs are around $7 a la carte, soft drinks are about $4. Communication from employees is poor. Rides would go offline with numerous people in line, and nothing would be announced. People would be standing in line to take a picture with a character, and the character would leave without patrons being told if they would return, at all. Disneyland is an amusement park on steroids, and they know they've got you right in their claws. Do it once for your kids, then just go to the local amusement park in your state each of the next three or four summers for the same price you are paying for this one trip to Disney."
2323,2019-2,Even after all these years Disneyland is a special place to visit.  The crowds are huge but it is worth the visit.
2324,2019-2,We had another wonderful time at the Disney park. It wasn't too crowded. Enjoyed the rides earlier in the day and fast track passes in the evening. Night parades and lights show. Always a magical time. Been coming for 50 years.
2325,2019-2,"We went on a Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  Thursday was the best day to go.  Friday the park closed early for the Halloween celebration so we had to leave the park by 7.  Saturday was extremely busy!!"
2326,2019-2,"Just spent a day in Disney in California. This is a fabulous place to visit, especially with children. That said  being Disney, my expectations were high and this fell short. A few of the attractions were closed.The staff at the park I expected to be so friendly and happy  truth is a lot of staff don't smile and seem decidedly unhappy and frustrated. This was very disappointing as was a lot of the Chinese made merchandise. For food, disappointing and they seem to insist on you waiting even if there are empty tables! Some great things to do but wouldn't return. "
2327,2019-2,"Took Pictures even with the Cast Members (employees of Disney) helping with our camera and there's, got on rides, shopped, at some yummy food at the Character Breakfast and Made a lot of Wonderful Memories ."
2328,2019-2,What hasn't been said about the Happiest Place on Earth? This place was my childhood and I continue to visit often. Yes ticket prices and pretty much everything else are on the steep side but worth a visit at least once in your lifetime!
2329,2019-2,"This is one of my favorite places in the world. No matter how old you are, you're a kid when you're here. It's less fun, though, when it's packed. Like, hardly fun at all. In making your plans, check out the sites that predict forecast how busy it's likely to be when you're going. Weekdays and the winter are generally better. Another good way of dealing if it's crowded is to get there early, pick up your first FastPass and get in line for another popular ride. Or go after about 4, when families with young kids start leaving. You can get a FastPass every two hours, and that will save you tons of time in line.Take an empty water bottle, as water is about $3 a bottle there. Bring your own food, if you can. At the very least, bring a banana or two. It'll help give you some energy, they're easy to carry, and you'll keep your expenses down. It's almost impossible to find healthy food anywhere in the park; the veggie wrap in Tomorrowland and the fruit you can find at carts here and there are about the closest you'll get. Food and beverages everywhere in the park are super expensive. Also: remember to pace yourself."
2330,2019-2,"It's Disney. You know what to expect. Smaller than it's Florida big brother, but Disney brilliance and efficiency everywhere."
2331,2019-2,"Its not worth to spend hundreds of $$$ and all your energy just to waste most of day in lines waiting for quick rides. Also some ride areas were closed or experiencing technical difficulties while we waited in lines. We had fun time @ disney cruise and disney world but  Disneyland, nightmare come true . Disney should find new ways for better experience to visitors otherwise its way overcrowded."
2332,2019-2,"Disneyland was so clean, the staff were friendly and it was not crowded.    Attended Mickey's Halloween Party and it was great except the viewing area for sky show was not great."
2333,2019-2,"We were here in late September, crowds were tolerable. We purchased a single day park hopper and easily hit the highlights of each park (we are an adult couple). Fun to do while in the area."
2334,2019-2,Its Disney and it is awesome. Unexpectedly crowded for early October. Make reservations for dinning early when planning your trip. We did a place in CA Adventure and Cafe Orleans and Blue Bayou. Order the seasonal special at these two. You shouldn't be disappointed. Our time at Disney made up for our poor hotel. See Springhill Maingate review.
2335,2019-2,"The park was dressed up for Halloween , amazing pumpkins everywhere carved at the favourite Disney character, the best was to see the park is start early and fast pass everything .  If you have No kids under 8 avoid fantasyland till affterdark as this...More"
2336,2019-2,Disney does everything well but we were all disappointed in tune town which we now wish we had skipped entire even though we visited with a f and four year old. Slens hue time in fantasyland instead....... I also hate how much they charge for parking.
2337,2019-2,"The security line to get into the area to purchase tickets and stand in line to get in takes half an hour. Then the line to get in takes another half hour because they take pictures of everyone, even if you are entering for only a day. RIDICULOUS. Terrible way to start a day at  the happiest place on Earth. "
2338,2019-2,Never seen so many people in one place.  Was hard to get on rides long queues.  Visit on a week day  Still a magical place.
2339,2019-2,"We've gone to Disneyland 23 times this year and each time we had to play it by ear, especially with 2 toddlers. Amazingly there are TONS of rides and things to do for toddlers. Here are some things we found valuable after our experiences this year with a 1 year old and a 3 year old....1) For starters it is most manageable if you have 3 adults for every 2 toddlers while at DL. You will need an extra set of hands especially if you have one that is potty trained and the other one in diapers. It is very difficult to manage DL with 2 toddlers and only 2 adults. A 3rd adult can help wait in line for you, watch 1 of the kids while you need to go buy food or use the restroom, or just need a break. There is so much activity going on at DL, toddlers are curious   so it is VERY easy to lose them if someone is not watching them all the time. A 3rd adult can help when you're trying to take pictures. 2) If you are flying to California and don't want to lug a heavy stroller   rent one from City Strollers. We rent a double stroller from them every time we go   the plus side is they deliver to your hotel!3) Stay at a hotel within walking distance of the park. We stay at the Marriott Courtyard or Marriott Fairfield Inn on Harbor Blvd. It's only a 10 min walk to the park and it is well worth coming back to the hotel for mid day naps for parents AND Toddlers. Use the blackout curtains and everyone will be sound asleep in no time!4) GET UP early and get to the park at least 15 minutes before it opens. It takes a while to get through Disney security, especially if they are at 100% inspections. The gates open before the park opens because there is usually  Magic Morning  hours for people staying at one of the resort hotels. 5) Eat breakfast BEFORE you get to the park so you're not wasting time when the lines are the SHORTEST in the morning. I like to pack oatmeal, yogurt and fruit for the kids in the morning   easy to make before you leave the hotel.6) Go to FANTASYLAND first.... no matter how fast you run... Peter Pan will be the longest wait of all the rides in Fantasyland.. .and it usually stays that way ALL DAY... if it is a  Magic Morning  for resort guests   by the time you get there the line will already be 60 min long. Leave someone in line for you while you take the kids on King Arthur's Merry Go Round.. .because Toddlers don't do well standing in long lines. There is rarely ever a line for Snow White or Pinocchio since small kids are afraid of them. If you  talk  your kids though the entire rides, it makes it bearable for them.7) After a few rides, stop to rest for SNACK TIME. Pack some snacks for your kids in a cooler. DL lets you bring in your own food. Find a space where your tots can roam walk. In the mornings, we like to sit in the table area just below Casey Jr. Train.8) Storybook land Canal boats are also a must. If you're lucky you can ask to have your tots sit on the front of the boat (adults need to sit next to them)9)Take advantage of the Companion or Family restrooms   we've used the ones in Tomorrowland by Autopia, Below the Hungry Bear Restaurant and near the Fairy Tale Theater near Its a Small World.10)Download the Disneyland App to quickly see wait times and show times. You can also link your photo pass to the app. Whenever a Disneyland Photographer takes your family photos, pull up the app and let the photographer scan your QR code in the app to instantly download the pictures to your phone. You can preview them and decide if you want to purchase.11) Ride the monorail and ask if you can ride in the very front. It is a max of 4 people in the front cabin but if there isn't a line for it, it's a great experience.We've done this 23 times this year and it is tiring... there are some days we find that we need to relax a bit so we strongly recommend a glass of wine at Club 33 if you know someone or have membership yourself. If not, the Carthay Circle Lounge in CA Adventure has superior service, excellent food and a full bar for a nice glass of red wine."
2340,2019-2,Overall its your typical idea that you can imagine at disneyland lots of fun activities just so many people lol
2341,2019-2,Just visited disneyland for the first time and found it to be great for age groups under 12. I definitely wouldn't go there for the thrill rides but in saying that the excitement in the park is amazing. There is proformers everywhere.
2342,2019-3,Fun time in Disneyland. Great time to go is mid  week to avoid large crowds. Love going for Halloween and Christmas. There's always something magical about this place once you enter the gates!
2343,2019-3,"We've been coming for years and they never disappoint. The cast members are very friendly and if you have a celebration, birthday, etc pin they will wish you well. It's always very clean and the good is amazing. If you can, bring your own water bottles and snacks as that gets expensive."
2344,2019-3,"Kristen was one of the photographers that took our photos at the park! She was amazing! My fianc  , proposed out in front of Sleeping Beauty's castle during magic morning hours on our first day and she was the photographer when the moment happened. She captured so many beautiful, detail specific photos during the proposal. I will be forever grateful to her for the photos! Thanks Kristen! "
2345,2019-3,"We were at Disneyland with three generations of our family. With 12 people in your group you need to be organised.We planned all the activities  rides we wanted to do before hand to be efficient with our time.Two things that helped us use our time well:1. Get fast passes. Especially for rides like Indiana Jones and space mountain. Although we were there in the quiet season there were still some 90 minute wait times but if you get fast passes you can avoid wait times. You can only hold one fast pass at a time.2. If you are travelling with someone with mobility issues make sure you talk to staff at each ride because you can get a pass to skip the line. This is very helpful in fantasy land because there are no fast passes.Make sure you enjoy the fireworks on the weekend. I take my hat off to the staff. During our two days there I saw them deal with lots of tired  frustrated  impatient  rude patrons. Although you could tell some staff didn't want to, they continued to smile through it all.There is so much more to do other than go on the rides such as collecting badges, performances and getting autographs. Enjoy it all!The food is pretty average and expensive. You can try to sneak food in but they conduct pretty through bag searches. You can get cheap disney merchandise from Walmart etc."
2346,2019-3,"Original Disneyland park is a must see. It's adorable and if I had more time I would love to do the tour where you  walk in Walt's footsteps . I loved it! I think every Disney fan must see this park. WDW fanatics might see the negatives....It is very small and cramped for moving and growing room. The entrances to rides are not well marked. Many cast members are rude roll their eyes at questions  told me to look at the app for answers, even though they could answer them the old fashioned way 'face to face'. Although I loved Disneyland, I'm a huge WDW fan and although I won't pass on another trip to Disneyland, I prefer my big Ol' Magic Kingdom."
2347,2019-3,"Having been to Disney World quite a few times in the past, the day we spend at Disneyland during our Honeymoon in the LA area was quite a disappointment. There were so many things closed for refurbishment that it was just ridiculous. Finding just traditional american food (burgers, chicken, etc withut a ton of regional spices seasoning) was next to impossible without traversing half the park. Even on a weekday, the park seemed pretty packed with kids (don't they have school in California???). For the price of the ticket, I'd look elsewhere for entertainment unless you have kids who really want to go here."
2348,2019-3,The crowds were managed well.  We stayed on property which was the biggest blessing.  I felt completely safe.  The security checks were the longest lines we experienced. But worth it.  I can't wait to take my grand noodle.
2349,2019-3,"What a way to celebrate my 37th Birthday. My first visit to Disneyland and was such a amazing experience. Really felt the cast celebrate my birthday with me...Loved the atmosphere, the Disney tunes playing, the smell of holiday. My top 2 rides was definitely the Indiana Jones and Big thunder mountain but we got to experience a good 15 rides while we where there and not 1 dissapointed. Food was great. Will be back. Thank you Disneyland!"
2350,2019-3,Loved the nostalgic feel of Main Street and the themes they have captured in other areas of the park. October was a great time to go as the queues were not bad at all and we easily got to ride everything we wanted to. The food was much better quality than I expected. Harbour galley for lobster bisque and lobster roll was great. We came back for the evening Halloween party and was amazed at the atmosphere created. Well done Disney! 
2351,2019-3,I love Disneyland and have completed the global Disney grand slam. The place continues to delight. However I've got to say that some standards of the park have slipped a bit. I did not find the place as clean or as friendly as in previous visits.
2352,2019-3,This place is one of the most memorable places to go! Great rides throughout the entire park! This place is a must visit!
2353,2019-3,Everyone knows about Disneyland so I'll just say it was wonderful as always. What was new to us was the Walk in Walts Footsteps Tour. Our tour started at 9:30am which meant we got to enter the park 30 minutes early and get an awesome picture in front of the castle without other people around! We also got to ride 2 rides without waiting in line (Alice in a Wonderland and It's a Small World). The highlight of our tour was visiting the Dream Suite above Pirates. It was filled with Walts touches of magic. Our guide was also really wonderful and you could tell how much she truly enjoyed Disney and it's History. 
2354,2019-3,I had been to the Orlando Disney World over 20 times this is my first time to Disneyland in California. It's definitely not as big but was very clean for as many people that were there the ride lines or not too bad especially if you got there early before school got out. As expected food and drinks were not cheap I was not expecting it to be. Fast pass is well worth it
2355,2019-3,"It doesn't matter if you're 2 or 60 years old. This place is magical and absolutely beautiful. My family enjoyed it quite a bit. It was a little crowded since we went on a sunday, even though it was suppossed to be low season. But it totally worth it. Some of the attractions had long lines and sometimes we couldn't even get to stay away from the sun, but at the end, we enjoyed it a lot. Parades are beautiful, although I wish they could include more characters. It was odd that Daisy didn't show up at all, and my daughters were hoping to see Ana & Elsa along with the rest of the princesses, but they didn't show up either. "
2356,2019-3,Overrated and overpriced. Not recommended for teenagers. More for kids under the age 10. Kids were bored after a few hours and pretty much just wanted to spend time at hotel or in the pools. Fast pass is a good idea but didnt like getting a fast pass like 1:00pm and get told you need to come back in four hours to go on a ride. 
2357,2019-3,"This was the fifth visit to Disneyland within the past three years and it is still the best and happiest place on Earth! No matter when I visit, I get completely immersed in the sights, sounds, tastes, and sensations that permeate the entire park. When visiting, please prepare to let yourself go and be a kid again. To get the most value out of the price of admission, plan on staying as long as you can and enjoy the park at a leisurely pace. Be sure to use the FASTPASS system as much as possible for the large attractions such as Space Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Haunted Mansion and visit the smaller attractions in between. Wait times can be longer when the park is full so be prepared to wait. In my experience, the wait and anticipation make the rides even more enjoyable. There are rides and shows for everyone's taste. Along with the attractions, be sure to enjoy the beautiful scenery and landscaping that adds so much to the whole experience. There are a couple places where I enjoy a relaxing respite to the fun activities. The first is the Enchanted Tiki Room where the birds still serenade you with nostalgic and comical songs from days gone by. Enjoy the show outside before going into the dark and cool theater that will soon be filled with songs and smiles. Second, enjoy a relaxing ride on the train around the park. The train visits several stations and has surprise panoramas that entertain young and old alike. Every ride and attraction tells a story so immerse yourself in each experience. Be sure to dress comfortably and bring your Mickey Mouse ears! This is a place where you don't need to worry about wearing a Donald Duck cap or Pluto Ears. Dress up and show off your Disney flair!Dining can be as simple as a corndog and burgers to more complex tastes and textures found at the various sit down restaurants. Yes, it can be expensive but the food is fresh, flavorful, and prepared at Disneyland instead of from some international chain restaurant. I recommend the French Market Restaurant or the Plaza Inn for substantial and delicious meals. At the end of the day, be sure to enjoy a parade, a show, or the fireworks before calling it a night. Finally, I think Disneyland offers amazing holiday experiences. The Halloween or Christmas spirit is everywhere and brings back fond memories of both seasons. I would recommend going during these holidays to really enjoy these special times of the year.Enjoy yourself, be a kid again, and experience the happiest place on Earth!"
2358,2019-3,"Visited the park with our 2 year old. Had a very enjoyable time. It was a Wednesday but yet still busy. Average wait times were 15 20mins for  standard  rides and 30 40mins for  popular  rides. The Mickey's Soundsational Parade (started at 3pm, Main St) was amazing. Make sure you get a good spot early. Lots of great rides for our 2 year old (more than California Adventure Park we thought). Lots of great food options to choose from too."
2359,2019-3,"I grew up on Disneyland. It seems to take your cares away for a day. But nowadays,it's a struggle to walk through the park, or even plan a meal. If you spend 8 hours there, it probably means one meal and 7 rides max.I prefer to go walk around for the decorations, enjoy the sentimental feelings brought back from childhood & accept it is... what it is. Hard to get to, costly, too crowded, always.Basically, a walk down memory lane."
2360,2019-3,"More people per square inch than Dacca, and it was Tuesday. Disneyland is what it is   fun, exciting, expensive, ground breaking, kitch, ad nauseum, but on a smaller scale than its strapping younger brother, Orlando's Magic Kingdom. Be prepared to be josteled in both places, but the squeeze is tighter in Anaheim."
2361,2019-3,"We go every year for Mickey's Halloween Party and are never disappointed! It is so much fun and, of course, kid oriented. The kids had a blast and so did the adults!"
2362,2019-3,"I grew up with Disneyland.  I'm 61 years of age same as Disneyland & still get a kick out of the park!! It's Halloween Time now @ Disneyland & California Adventure. Great fun , but long lines on a Tuesday in the daytime."
2363,2019-4,"Went here a day after visiting Universal Studios, and if you can only pick one park, I suggest going to Universal. Disneyland was too crowded and felt very disjointed and disorganized. The Woody parking area was too far and we had to take a boring bus ride to the park. This really did not set the mood for a fun day. The lines inside the park were longer than at Universal, with not much of a reward waiting. (Skip the Peter Pan ride!) Getting out of the park was hellish. There were no guides on how to get to the designated parking area and if you make the mistake of taking the wrong exit, you have to line up to get back inside for a security check. Waiting for the bus was also a nightmare, with no benches to rest our tired, weary bodies."
2364,2019-4,"We visited because our 3 1 2 year old granddaughter is fascinated by the Disney Princesses. There are three major places to meet and greet the various princesses: Hollywood land next to the Hyperion for a meet and greet with Elsa and Anna. The Royal Room in Sleeping Beauty's Castle for a meet and greet with three of the princesses (Cinderella, Snow White, and Rapunzel on the day of our visit). Ariel's Grotto for meet and greet with Ariel and several other princesses during a sit down breadfast. All the princesses were very nice to my grand daughter and signed her autograph book and posed for photos. None of them gave the impression of being rushed. My grand daughter's dream of interacting with the Disney Princesses really came true."
2365,2019-4,"As an East Coast resident who considers Walt Disney World my Disney  home,  I eagerly anticipated a trip to California which which would allow me to spend three days in Disney California Adventure and Disneyland Park.As a Disney fanatic and history buff, I was thoroughly immersed in the stories and history of the developments of Disneyland in the early 50s. I know most of the back stories of all the attractions, shows, and restaurants   even the ones that are no longer present.Still, to walk through the entrance gates and see the train station and flower Mickey for the first time was very special.Turning the corner onto Main Street, and looking down the street toward Sleeping Beauty Castle, I was instantly transported to the mental pictures of Walt Disney and his team bringing his vision of a  theme  park to reality.The Jungle Cruise was my first stop, and I had a great  skipper  who made the attraction a fun trip. Familiar with the story, I still enjoyed the corny jokes and sight gags.Pirates of the Caribbean was next, and once again, it was a great experience.I closed out that side of the park with the Haunted Mansion   all made up with the Holiday theme and Jack Skellington present.In each of these three attractions, I was very familiar with their origins and development. I have been on the WDW version of each of these, and count them my favorites there.However, I must say the experience of these three at Disneyland Park was unique, special, and different   not better, not worse, just different in the good kind of way.The highlight of my day was the various interactions with many Cast Members, who went about their roles with the spirit of Walt Disney very present; young or old, attraction host or custodial team, every single encounter I had ( and I spoke with dozens of Cast Members, because that's how I roll) through action and or language displayed what makes Disneyland unique among theme parks in general and the Disney properties specifically: this was  Walt's playground,  his crowning achievement in a very distinguished career.Somehow, just being in the place where Walt spent the last years of his life made all the difference in the world.I can't wait to go back!"
2366,2019-4,"I guess it was busy weekend, but all the rides worked and the lines weren't too long.  The cast members were great!"
2367,2019-4,"We really can't get enough of Disneyland. Its really our home away from home. Living in Vegas, we can get there in 4 short hours and enjoy a weekend away from all the crazy of normal life. Its nice to find a place where there are smiles and giggles   even from the adults! Love love love!!"
2368,2019-4,"Halloween Party 09 28 16, best ever.  It is so much fun, my family just loved the party.  IT'S HALLOWEEN, HALLOWEEN, HALLOWEEN, is stuck in my head."
2369,2019-4,"We had a great day at Disneyland. We visited in October so the park was decorated for Halloween. We arrived when the park opened to beat the crowds. We managed to get on most of the popular rides within the first four hours without spending more than 10 minutes in each line. We utilized the fast pass option where available. I downloaded the Disneyland app prior to my visit and was so helpful. It has a park maps and shows wait times for each ride, where the characters are at any given time or their next appearance, closest restrooms, store information etc. I thought the park itself was very nice, staff very helpful and seemed genuinely happy to work there but I felt that the rides themselves were very outdated. The park should consider a complete refurbishment of the rides. Universal Studios has much superior attractions. My favorites rides were The Haunted Mansion, Big Thunder, Matterhorn and Star Tours. The parade was excellent and worth watching. Plan to spend the whole day here but wear comfortable shoes!"
2370,2019-4,"Spent two days here this weekend and we really enjoyed it. Brought me back to my childhood. Wonderful atmosphere just so dang crowded! I also feel like more drink options would be great. Offer smart water or other water, Dasani is gross. Also I was surprised to not see very many characters. I felt like they hid them away which is sad for the little ones. "
2371,2019-4,Gayle day at Disneyland. I wouldn't even care because I love my gay friends. The only problem is they do a lot of public display of affection and even my two year old notices. I feel they should alert you just in case you might be uncomfortable. And I am. I've seen more public display of affection and inappropriate behavior than in my whole life. Now it's definable not ALL of the couples heck some of them have their own kids. But the many that do participate in PDA. It's really sad we have come to this. I'm so disappointed. Many of the couple I've spoken to are very nice and totally enjoying their vacation. I spoke to one man and he told me that he and his partner likely wouldn't bring their own children to  gay day  when they have kids. Ugh. I feel bad for feeling this way. It's not okay for my husband and I to show PDA and I would think that's inappropriate at a theme park or any public place that has children. Sorry Disney. Disappointed Christian 
2372,2019-4,"We had two days in Disneyland.  A weekday and weekend day.  Do not go on the weekend if you can avoid it. The crowds were unbearable.   magic morning is worth the effort. During September and October they have a Halloween celebration each night and it's crazy busy and things close early to cater for this so be aware.We had a few rides break down that we wanted to go on but I guess they are very old so it's going to happen. What I can say is this park is hot, hot, hot. There is very little shade and nowhere to cool down. It's not like Universal that has covered waiting areas. Most line up areas are out in the sun.  Jedi training was great and worth the effort. My daughter loved it.   star tours is awesome.  toy story ride is loads of fun too.  Parade was excellent. Get a good spot close to the rope and sit down till it's starts.   space mountain and madderhorn are old rides now. They jerk all over the place and and not that enjoyable.   my kids loved all the fantasyland rides and mickey toontown roller coaster.   we watched the fireworks from the balcony each night they were great and the fire works at Angels stadium are great too.  "
2373,2019-4,Their fireworks show is trully magical!!! (One thing I really enjoyed in HK disneyland). Their attractions and shows are for kids.
2374,2019-4,"You are never too old for Disneyland, and we had a blast here! The rides were awesome! Especially the Star Wars ride. We walked through the different lands and went on all of the rides we could. An awesome day! One exhibit was closed, but one out of everything was fine! "
2375,2019-4,"This is one small crowded Disneyland and to be honest, the tourists that frequent this place aren't the most considerate. Definitely my least favourite Disneyland."
2376,2019-4,"Brilliant, from setting off from Causeway Bay to arriving at Disneyland. Last part of journey was on the Disney train.Not as busy as Florida's Disneyworld so more chance of going on all the rides when you want to.Has a lot of the razzamataz of Disneyworld.We have visited on two occasions, and enjoyed both equally. Try it, you won't be disappointed."
2377,2019-4,"The children had a lot of fun at this HK park, waiting time for the attractions was not too long (surely we did not go in the peak season).  Average food quality, fast food type, as in all Disneyland locations tough."
2378,2019-4,"Hongkong Disneyland is just a must see destination especially for families and parents with kids. I was never a fan of rides and amusement parks, but Hongkong Disneyland somehow captured the kid in me. Lol. We had a great time enjoying the rides and the shops were captivating and irresistible. You just want to buy those souvenirs and take them home. But just a tip though  make sure to check the weather prior to your visit. It rained when we went there so it's best to bring a raincoat, especially for kids. The food are bit pricey but there are lots of choices when it comes to dining. Also, make sure to stay till 8pm to watch the parade and the fireworks! It was truly magical!"
2379,2019-4,"In Hong Kong the whole park revolves around disney merchandising.You'll find an endless serie of similar shops selling all sort of toys and (mostly useless) gimmicks.The rollercoasters seem to target far younger crowds than else in the world, or better, they are family focused, with exhausted adults wearing disney outfits enduring infinite lines with children on tail. Even if I have nothing against it, I was expecting some more excitement for millennials and grown up kids, like you can find in Tokyo for example.Surely a missed opportunity."
2380,2019-4,"It's really a fun and enjoyable place to be. But the queue for photo taking with characters was too long. Average waiting time for photo taking is at least 1hr, and it was during weekdays. Queue for rides took very long as well. We had to choose what we wanted to do and skipped the rest. Unless you for 2 days. Gotta get to the performance and fireworks area before it starts to get crowded. It a performance not to be missed."
2381,2019-4,"Always great to go back to childhood, attractions were great but in the half day we had done most of them. It is more for kids but worth the visit!"
2382,2019-4,"This is a great Disney park. It's smaller than Disney World and Tokyo Disney, but it is very nice. Christmas was amazing. Everything is decorated as it would be in an early 20th century American small town. The lit the tree with LEDs that changed colors, couples in Victorian costume sang carols (the Christian ones too), and snow fell all along Main Street. The light and fireworks show was outstanding and every bit as good as Orlando. If you're in Hong Kong, you must spend a day and evening at HK Disney. "
2383,2019-4,"It's the smallest Disneyland. Really nice for younger kids though. Gift shop and their signature fireworks, princesses and figures, any essentials from Disney they have it all, just to a smaller scale and size. The restaurant is particularly good with food allergies. We were really impressed by their consciousness. They took extra mile to ensure the food is safe for our kid with allergy. Highly recommended if you are visiting Hong Kong."
2384,2019-5,"Our company gave us an out of the country trip to HongKong DIsneyland. Hongkong Disneyland is awesome. Everyone, no age limit, can enjoy the place. There are different kinds of attractions for different kinds of people. One day is not enough to tour and maximize your visit. Overall, it was an awesome experience for everyone. (November 2015)"
2385,2019-5,"This place is so magical you will be at your happiest in Asia! I say 1 whole day to cover the area, 2 days to enjoy parades and rides and 3 whole days to enjoy all attractions and shows! We stayed in the Disney Hotel, thus the great access and we were able to rest a few then return to the park energized!"
2386,2019-5,"As far as Disney goes this is a clean and friendly park. Everything stocked and open. Can do this in 2 full days with children. The lines aren't long. Except if you want a photo with characters Mickey and Mini  get there as soon as they open or half an hour before and go to the main circle and start lining up first. The first day we caught the train from central HK city  terrible idea   took too long to get there. Caught an uber home. Very quick, luxury and not too much more than the train (family of 5). Next day uber there and back. The only downside I would say is lack of food options and availability. If you're travelling with young children take food and drinks. It takes too long to go and find a food stall and then when you do they only serve the same thing   nothing healthy. "
2387,2019-5,"It's nice to be in Disneyland. It's makes me relax and happy. Going back to be a child again. No problem, no worries, very happy."
2388,2019-5,"very nice spread. all the activities, Thrills, rides and attraction are amazing. We fully enjoyed. One is definitely not enough. You need alteast 2 days to enjoy all attractions. You should be ready to walk lot. but having good facilities. the Disney attractions, parade is very nice. children enjoyed most."
2389,2019-5,Been there with a friend of mine in November 2016. We really enjoyed the rides and had a super great time there. Amazing night parade and fire works show. Felt like a child all over again!!
2390,2019-5,"Pretty disappointed. There isn't much to do here other than walk around the park. The 4d movie was good. There was a main stage play that everyone waited hours in line for but we found out after we waited for hours that it wasn't in English (unlike everything else). There was one ride, it was like a western gold rush ride and it was pretty good! We only saw one Disney princess very late in the day as we were leaving. It was always a dream to go to Disneyland but I was sadly so disappointed."
2391,2019-5,It was our first time at a Disneyland hotel and it was truly a memorable experience. We stayed in the kingdom club room and the services they offer were truly luxurious. The resort is very nice and paradise for children. Definitely recommended for family holidays. Good service and food. Their charges are a bit premium but totally worth the money.
2392,2019-5,Visiting Disney was certainly a fun experience and it was interesting to witness a Disneyland as far away as Hong Kong! Obviously pretty similar to the rest regarding the rides however one thing we noticed was the lack of queues! Didn't have to queue for longer than 5 minutes on any ride   definite plus side compared to the American Disneys!
2393,2019-5,"One of the company's parks, it has many attractions similar to other Disney parks. The name, however, boosts the entrance ticket cost to high levels. Nightly fireworks display at 8 pm. Easy access by car or MTR train."
2394,2019-5,"Everything you would expect from a Disney theme park. The mark is on the smaller side but everything is new and maintained. The best part is the private train to the park, very easy and accessible."
2395,2019-5,This is one of the famous attraction in HK. I think it is worth to visit especially if you have children or if you are Disney fans. It was quite relaxing and great for photos taking.
2396,2019-5,"You can ultimately enjoy HK Disneyland in 1 day! Providing you come really early to avoid long lines in popular rides.Try these rides first: Space Mountain, Grizzly, and Adventures of Pooh. I know Adventures of Pooh sounds like a ride for kids only, but the lights and effects are pretty neat and magical! A soft ride, but the effects are really eye candy! Some restaurants were not opened when we visited. Better check out Hong kong Disneyland's website to see which restaurants are not opened and the schedule of shows for the day you will visit. The schedule will be available a week before your visit date.HK Disneyland's meals are pretty expensive. Ranging from HKD 99 to 200. I recommend getting a meal voucher on klook.com for a sweet deal. We used our meal voucher on an expensive meal and saved around PHP 200 .Churros and grilled squid are great! Ice Cream bars are okay. They taste normal. Popcorn was very sweet.The Parades are a must see! To get a better location, find a spot and stay there an hour before parade starts. :DFor those suffering from vertigo, Space mountain might be a little too much. But if you really want to try it out, avoid having a full stomach. You will get dizzy because the ride is poorly lit. I got dizzy and was on the verge of puking, so I avoided any rough rides for an hour or 2. You can go for the slow rides like the adventure of pooh and it's a small world. Eat something. You're ready for the next rough ride."
2397,2019-5,Pros:    Easily accessible via MTR    Plenty of rides to choose from kids to kids at heart    Helpful guides  Cons:    Expensive Disney merchandise
2398,2019-5,Plus:   Millions of attraction offered  Good for children  Friendly staffs  CleanMinus:  Expensive  Lack of signage  Scheduled photo sessions can ruin your plan in the park  Long queue on many attractions makes your time spent uselessly   Requires 2 days to get all amusements
2399,2019-5,"Everything is magical, as always! From the Disneyland train at Sunny Bay to its bathrooms! I am so in love with the Hyperspace Mountain ride! I can live there!"
2400,2019-5,"Reaching : easy connected via metro  Place : Good for kids only, will be upset if you seen US  Cost : very costly for the time you spend"
2401,2019-5,"Hong Kong Disneyland was the 4th Disney Park for me to visit, and like the others it just oozes joy. It might be a little smaller than the American Parks, but it is just as enjoyable. Unfortunately it didn't have some popular rides such as the Matterhorn and Star Tours, but they did have Hyperspace Mountain. They also have a different version of the Haunted Mansion, which is a good experience.The lights   fireworks display was something different to what I have experienced before, as images were projected onto the castle which I thought was a very nice touch."
2402,2019-5,"I felt sad that we went there without my children, i myself felt like a child again as soon a we enter, i cant seem to know where to start taking pictures bec every character, seen, ride is breathtaking, parade in the morning and in the evening was enchanting, i cant wait to bring my children when i go back hopefully soon"
2403,2019-5,"We really loved our time here. The  cast members  were so helpful and kind. We went twice, both on weekdays. I can't imagine it being more crowded. Lots of people!!Pros: Loved the Lion King show. Be sure to go see that (or any other show for that matter.  Kind  crew members . They would take pictures with your phones. LOVED that!!! Frequent opportunities for pictures with characters.  Loved the main strip... especially the afternoon parade. Don't miss that!!!! The evening fireworks are great. We went for Christmas and they even shot out fake snow onto the main strip. My little girls loved that.  Decorated well for the season. Cons: Price! So expensive. Nearly everything costs something. There's a lot of commercials, too. They make you exit via gift shops. That's common for a park, but not after individual rides. You'd think the high price of admission would cover other things. But I guess that keeps away the masses.  it's DisneyLand in Hong Kong. Where is Mulan?! Seriously, Disney... how was this overlooked? Maybe she's in ShangHai, now that they have a park there.  I had high hopes for the Toy Story part. Wasn't very good, especially for small children."
2404,2019-5,"Although it's the smallest Disneyland park in the world, it's also the only one that has tropical surroundings, which is cool. The attractions that i definatelly recommend are Mystic Manor, Big Grizzly Mountain and Hyperspace Mountain, also a nice show with 4D movie   Mickey's Philarmagic.Not to be missed here, in my oppinion, are also the fireworks at the castle, the  Paint the night  parade and during the winter holidays, the Christmas tree lighting show."
2405,2019-6,"Ok, I shall agree that once you are in Hong Kong and don't have enough time, you may skip Disney park. However, ir you are a Disney lover, or if you are in HK with children, you definitely should visit the park. The smallest Disney park among the current six, HK Disney carries the soul of Disney, the magic of Disney universe and the people who make HK Disneyland happen every day will make sure that the visitors are having a nice time while visiting them. As a hint, if you don't like hot weather, avoid visiting the park on summer."
2406,2019-6,"My hubby decided to choose here over Macau during our HK holiday trip since neither of us have been to any Disneyland yet and this is the closest.I've to say, we enjoyed it thoroughly and with such a fine, cool winter weather end of the year, it make our walk more enjoyable without the sweat during summer time.Although it may be the smallest among all Disneyland, it still took us a full day to walk, ride, eat, shop and we managed to catch two parades; one in the afternoon and the other during night time. The only thing we didn't managed to do was to catch and take a close up photos with all the Disney characters due to the timing that's scheduled.In terms of transportation, there is a direct MTR from Hong Kong station to Disneyland, which you have to interchange at Sunny Bay and you will come across a Mickey Mouse decorated MTR trains to Disneyland. It is advisable to go during weekdays when it is less crowded compared to weekend. Also, with me at my second trimester pregnancy, most of the rides are pregnancy friendly with one or two rides only. To me, this was more than good enough for me as I was able to still enjoy 95% of the rides.I definitely wouldn't mind going back again if I am in HK."
2407,2019-6,"go to Disneyland is very enjoy. People work there is fun, games is also fun. Food is good. But i like most is the games and shows. Everyone i see is have fun and is smiles. Also me is smile. I come again there with my two baby. They tell me they like too."
2408,2019-6,"A total cheerful place, awesome time spent with family and friends.A must visit place and worth waiting for the Night Parade and Fireworks.I'd say for anyone visiting, download a map online first and ask people what all things are must watch, that way your time is spent wisely."
2409,2019-6,"Disneyland  always  cheering place  for  the  kids  to  adults.  May  not  complete  in  one  day  but  must  see  evening  parade,  fireworks  and  other  colourful  photo  session.  There  is  specially  one  MTR  station  right  after  the  main  gate."
2410,2019-6,"went there with family, awesome fun, shows n rides.There is free wifi throughout most of the park and that worked well with the Disneyland app. Recommended for young couple with kid!"
2411,2019-6,"The smallest of all of the Disneyland resorts, this one doesn't boast many 'high speed thrilling' rides   more ones for 5 10 year olds. (if you want rollercoasters, head to ocean park). Tickets are quite expensive and good luck if you think you can leave without taking something home from the extensive gift shops! For little ones, this is great and would be a really lovely family day out. Bring cash, a small bag, an umbrella and your own drinks if you can. My favourite parts   The River cruise, The runaway mine cars and the toy story blaster ride."
2412,2019-6,"Make sure you spend a whole day in Disneyland. Don't forget to watch their fireworks at the end. Disney had the best fireworks show. If you want to had dinner   lunch, you can try one of Maxim's Restaurant there. They had a yummy beef brisket menu."
2413,2019-6,"We had a great day at Disneyland. Wasn't very busy when we visited, minimal wait for rides. Park was very clean and well maintained. Merchandise was well priced, not overly expensive. Main street parade was great. Definately worth a visit if your in Hong Kong :) "
2414,2019-6,"I booked a 2 days trip for end Nov. I heard a lot from friends that 1 day is good enough...but in reality, it has so many attractions, rides, shows and a paraphernalia of things to do.I am glad I booked a 2 days trip, because even if you get in at 10am and done by 8pm, you still will not even cover even 20% of the whole area. The queues on weekends can take up to 45 minutes...but then its popular like the parachute jumps.Even the shows are immensely popular! Never regret going and will take my kids to another Disney location."
2415,2019-6,"This was fantastic as I found the Disney Characters easily accessible to gain photos, although not as big as Disney Anaheim I though it was better and easier to get around as it's on a smaller scale than the States.You get there early and have the park to yourself it seems, great rides and a fantastic street with all the shops.The night parade was the highlight and comes with a great atmosphere.Everything is easily accessible and you can stay close at one of the Disney Hotels or just catch the train straight from the city.The Disney ride was also fantastic and enjoyed by the whole family.I can highly recommend it and would love to go back someday."
2416,2019-6,"I have been to the original Disneyland in LA and also to Disney World in Florida and my wife has been to Disneyland Japan, but we both kept an open mind going to Disneyland Hong Kong, it would do no justice to Disneyland Hong Kong to make comparisons. That being said Disney HK is a good place to go with kids for sure, but ideally it should be done on a weekday unless you want lots of pain and go on a weekend. I can only imagine the waiting time in the rides on a weekend given the over all size of Disney HK. You have to spend a day here to get to ride all the rides for sure. I also suggest not doing this on a hot summer day, late November is good as it is sunny but cool. Getting to Disney HK is easy with lots of public transportation available so that is not a hassle at all."
2417,2019-6,take a child with you to see their excitement. I had my 4 yr old grandson to see how they enjoyed. there are any number of locations to spend the whole day. time passes to the night until the fireworks ending the show.
2418,2019-6,"I had some time off and had squezeed on my schedulle to visit Disney ... i'm a big fan.Here we are talking about a samll version of Magic Kingdom   Orlando's amusement park ... woth the trip ,,, you will have a great time ..."
2419,2019-6,It was a fun day at HK Disneyland. They had lighting of the Christmas tree when we visited and they even let us experience snow! There were a lot of Disney merchandise as usual. They also sold Mickey Mouse pancake which was cute. The line to have a picture with Mickey Minnie Mouse and Donald Daisy Duck and Tigger Sofia the Princess was tooooo long that we had to content ourselves with photobombing them hehe we didnt try the rides at all as that was not our thing. The place is accessible by mtr. 
2420,2019-6,We had a magical day with our 3 year old daughter who was ecstatic to meet the princesses in real life! One day is totally enough to cover the entire park which isn't so big. The food wasn't good and it was very expensive!!! Recommend bringing your own. Definitely recommended to stay intil it gets dark and see the park in the dark and also don't miss the parade with lights in the evening!!! Amazing!
2421,2019-6,"Comparing experiences from Paris and Tokyo Disneyland:Atmosphere is duller compared to Paris and Tokyo. It would be nice to be able to see a list of all the character meet and greets somewhere on the website. Go on a non public holiday, school holiday to miss the crowds. We went during the week on a Thursday, rides were also abit of a wait (30 1hr) For a family with a toddler this is hard. There is a fastpass but with a toddler only 2 of these rides are applicable.It was warm, there were little shade for some of the rides when queuing up. Ended up only going on 4 rides as we wanted to see the parade at 3pm and some of the theatre shows. One of the theatre shows was half Cantonese and half English. Micky speaking Cantonese just doesn't cut it for me. Maybe for some it might.Shops and Disney paraphilia is good. I'm a bit shocked at the lack of beautiful Christmas decorations on sale, it was a little depressing to see that compared to our visit at the same time in December to Paris, where there were walls of beautiful Christmas decorations.Cons:UHT milk on sale at some food vendors but not coldFood is not tasty, a little disgusting compared to typical foods you can get in Hong Kong. it was also expensive for what you get."
2422,2019-6,Having been to other Disneyland locations  HK Disneyland is great for young kids but not preteens or teens. There are 4 exciting rides   of which 2 were closed for renovation. Many things were closed such as restaurants and eating stands. And the facility is old. The merchandise here is fairly boring and repetitive. Shows are highly recommended though  and worth watching (regardless of age). Food is decent. And take note of the hoards of tourists   as they might get rowdy during parades and closing time. Parades are really fun to watch and the staff are generally quite friendly and helpful. Would not recommend  it's a small world   don't bother and visit other parts of the theme park instead. 
2423,2019-6,"all the hype you hear about Disneyland, I was disappointed, maybe because its not the biggest Disneyland in the world, I was expecting a lot more rides and activities, but I did cross it off my bucket list, and what was there was good and enjoyable "
2424,2019-6,"After our arrival in Hong Kong, we went to Disneyland and it was a nice experience. We arrived there at 11am and did all attraction until 6pm. For groups it is perfect, even when the amount of thrilling attractions is not too huge, beside the 2 rollercoasters there are only a few other funny attractions. For kids it is perfect and they will really enjoy it. There are a lot of attractions for kids and it is totally worth it, to check out the promotions online, before you go there."
2425,2019-6,it is our 4th time to visit disneyland but first time bringing an infant. the parks gets improvement everytime we visit along with the increasing price for food. it is a bit expensive and the water sold is  mineral  i was unable to find distilled water for my infant inside the park. 
2426,2019-7,Great place to spend a day if you have a little more time in HK (we were there for 10 days). This is a small Disney park compared to the others round the world; it still offers all the usual Disney fun... but without the masses of people and huge queues. We had a great day.
2427,2019-7,"This is a fantastic resort to stay especially if you wish to visit the HK Disneyland. The rooms are awesome, they were set up with Mickey Mouse and balloons when we checked in. Try to book a room on the higher floor to get better view. Also try to request ocean view rooms. The breakfast spread is awesome and the experience itself is amazing with disney characters like mickey mouse visiting your table and entertaining your kids. The resort is nevertheless away from the city so not ideal if you want to visit attractions in the city as well, although there is a shuttle bus that connects with the MTR station in the HK disneyland. If you are at the resort, consider spending all that time in the resort itself and visiting Disneyland, then move to the city for another night or two. There are no shops   cafes   restaurants near the resort so the only lunch   dinner options are within the resort and the food is very expensive in the resort, so keep that in mind when you plan the travel."
2428,2019-7,"We first visited on a Friday afternoon and pretty much walked on all the big coaster rides. Grizzly Gulch was fantastic and we really enjoyed Mystic Manor. The night time parade was lovely and the fireworks fantastic. We found the cast members pretty friendly. The Lion King show was spectacular. We returned on Sunday and naturally it was much busier but we still rode Spacemountain and met R2D2. The rides for the young children seemed very long   we were lucky to go on the Pooh ride on Fri night after the fireworks which enabled us to only wait 15 mins. It is pretty much shoulder to shoulder here on a busy day and the shops are insane ! I don't know where people get their money from to spend so much!! Lol. We have visited Disneyland and Disneyworld in the USA and of course HK is much smaller but it was fascinating to visit a diff Disney all the same, especially an Asian one."
2429,2019-7,Plan ahead. Watch the 3 and 7 pm parade. Get a two day pass. 1 day is not enough to watch and do all the rides and show.
2430,2019-7,"We lucked out as the day we decided to visit the park the weather was gorgeous. I picked up a one day pass for everyone online so it was one less line to deal with at the park.Getting there, the hotel staff recommended we just take a taxi as prices seem to be under control and it was a lot less hassle. We took their advice and getting there involved zero stress or guesswork. From Kowloon to the park was just under 200 HKD.We were dropped off very close to the main gate and while making your way to the ticket counters you will have a chance for some photos. We got there about 11:30 and it seemed many people had the same idea even though the park is supposed to be open at 10am.First checkpoint was a security check for bags. Besides the obvious things they look for they also search for selfie sticks (monopods) as they are banned in the park. While we are on that subject, make sure you bring a phone charger or extra batteries. You will be taking loads of photos and video. Bring more than one picture taking advice as murphys law will dictate that the single unit you bring will have issues.Once past security we made it to the line to transfer your online tickets for real tickets. While in line we got to watch a number of folks having arguments with the security personnel about what they could bring in.Tickets in hand we made it inside and the first thing we see is the train station. The train will depart the entrance and go non stop to the top of the park and you will have to disembark. If you enter the train at the top of the park you will get a one way ride back top the entrance and again forced to disembark. Knowing what this train does can help you plan your park excursion.There were three major events we enjoyed. The Parade at 3pm another parade at 7pm and the fireworks at 8pm. These are must see events that just about everyone will enjoy. Get to the parade route along the  main street  area and get your  seat  on the curb at least half an hour early if you want front row action. The fireworks will be held at the castle so try and get positioned front and center to the castle to really enjoy that one.Another tip. Many of the disney cast and characters will set up photo opportunities at  random  times in appropriate places such as Alice by the teacup ride. This is a great opportunity for folks to get pictures with their favorite toons. Please keep in mind the toons need breaks and frequently we found ourselves in a line without a toon as the staff did a poor job in some instances to let the queue know who would actually be last so prepare for disappointment. Supposedly the toons take breaks from 15 30 minutes so if you time it right you can catch them again as they set up.If you are very pleasant and have a genuinely friendly outward demeanor, you may be able to convince some of the random  cast members  walking through the park to take photos with you. Even the people who play toons that are not famous still enjoy the opportunity to take photos with guests. Ask nicely and you can get some great opportunities. Another unknown bonus that was available are the free disney stickers that many toons, cast members and park staff will pass out. Even people working in the stores will have stickers to hand out. Again be nice and you will most likely be rewarded with a sticker.One oddity that we discovered were the Disney girls who seem to visit the park frequently, dress up and constantly pose all over the park for selfies (using smuggled selfie sticks). We are not sure if it is just a thing or if they are hoping to find the future Mr. Right. The ladies are friendly and pose no issues.We picked the month of November for the perfect weather and a regular day of the week to avoid school crowds. Our waits in line were rarely more than five minutes and we never really broke sweats due to the nice weather. Keep in mind this is still typhoon season in asia so you could face some rains. Give your self a few days to get lucky or plan to get a little wet. We think you will still have fun.OK the park and rides themselves are fantastic. I am not going to do a rundown of the sections or rides. I will say the roller coaster in the back by the mining operations was awesome. The Alice Tea cups are always a favorite. It's a small world boat ride is a winner. We also did what I believe was the raft ferry across the river to visit the tree house ala Tarzan. Back in the day it would have been Swiss Family Robinson. The Tarzan area does have some interactive activities and great photo opportunities.There is food and shopping everywhere. Shopping is all overpriced. There is no getting around that. Food in Hong Kong itself can be pricey but in the park even more so. I will have to recommend you avoid the fast food garbage like hamburgers and hot dogs and stick with water and real food. Sticking with the healthy option will likely help improve your chances for a pleasant day. When the fireworks are over, the staff will gently guide you out of the park. If your quick and nimble you can skirt your way past many of the visitors as they tend to lollygag on their way out. We did the beeline, avoided the subway train tour busses and were first in line for a cab. No waiting. We had a wonderful time and the staff was awesome despite dealing with a remarkably high number of ill mannered guests. These same guests will pose a challenge to your patience as well. It will not take you long to figure out who to avoid. Have patience as some cultures have an unusual view towards public politeness, manners and courtesy. Other than these few obstacles the park is wonderful and I wish to thank the Disney leadership for making it such a smooth running operation."
2431,2019-7,"We were debating if we should use the last day of our holiday for Disneyland and so glad we did. If you like Disney, even if you have been to the other parks, you will probably have a good time. (We have been to Disneyland in California, Florida and Tokyo. And, we had a really fun day at Hong Kong Disneyland). If you have been to a Disney park before, one full day is enough. We were there for 7 hours and did pretty much everything we wanted to. (Would have liked to stay longer for fireworks, etc., but had a flight to catch). We went on Sunday, November 27, a sunny day, and the lines were not bad. Compared to lines at other Disney parks, these lines are pretty short. (Fast Pass only for Winnie the Pooh and Hyperspace Mountain). But, you need to plan your time.We checked in and left our luggage for the Airport Express station in Kowloon, went to the park on the MTR and then straight to the airport on the MTR. Only took about 40 minutes from when we walked out the gate to when we walked in to the airport.While similar to other Disney parks, it has it's own special things. The Festival of the Lion King Show was excellent.Mystic Point is unique. Grizzley Gulch Mine Cars was unexpectedly good.There are discounts available, so purchase in advance. We booked on Klook and got 10% off. Also saves waiting to buy tickets."
2432,2019-7,Super time spent with family. Tickets were pre booked (advisable for all tourists else there are long queues for tickets). Be prepared for long walks....can be tiring but its very well maintained and has a nice touch to it. Kids will freak out on all the fun activities...plenty of options for snacks and meals. A bit over priced though !!! You may want to carry your own snacks. Carry plenty of water.
2433,2019-7,I didn't expect it to be expensive but its one of those you wouldn't mind paying for.I was early. And it was awesome to see Mickey n Minnie greeting the guests before the gates opened.The attractions were really nice. I took the Jungle River tour. It was amazing to see the guides really going all out to get the guests into the jungle element and feel.There were a few attractions under construction or not opened but it was still great.
2434,2019-7,"My daughters are enjoying themselves in the park. Too many people and the queue are too long. Not change to take photo with Mickey and Elsa. however, the girls really enjoy themselves there. the fireworks is really wonderful and it is amazing. the parade is also wonderful."
2435,2019-7,"Whether you are a kid or a kid at heart, it is always worth going to Disneyland. Tickets may be bought online or directly at the entrance for 1 day or 2 day visits. Download the MTR mobile app for easy navigation of which train connections to take. The Disney MTR ends right at the Disney entrance so there will be no long walks for you. I used UBER taxi going there then the MTR for a ride home. Have fun!"
2436,2019-7,Great value for your dollar here as admission is about 1 4 of the cost of Disney parks in the USA. It is smaller than other Disney parks but not as crowded so we got to ride on every attraction with virtually no wait and as many times as we wanted. Kids loved the rides even though the new Ironman Experience hadn't opened when we were there. Not to miss! 
2437,2019-7,A good tip is to get a two day ticket in advance as the queue at the park can be long. You have to be quick on your feat if you want to do this in one day. Check out the shows they are good. 3 big theatres. Take food with you as the meals are   10 each coke is   3. There is a bag search before entry for alcohol but normal drink and food are allowed. Stay for the night parade as this is worth it.
2438,2019-7,"It seems odd going there in a short sleeved T shirt to be greeted by Jingle Bells and various other Christmas songs, but this is a lovely Disney with very cheap for the over 65s."
2439,2019-7,"Disneyland is not to be missed especially with kids. Be sure to take a stroller because there is plenty of walking and stroller parking outside the activity areas are available. It is best to take a 2 day pass if you have the time because to cover such a vast area in a day is not possible. The queues for photos with Mickey and Minnie are huge... You get a photo pass card wherein can log in online and view the photo and buy it (keep in mind till you dont buy u cannot even download the photo!) Its a small world ,  Winnie the pooh ,  Mystic manor  are the attractions i really enjoyed. Even the  Cinderella Carousel  was awesome. The queues are huge but the good part is that the wait time is displayed outside the ride so u can decide if u want to go or not.Try and go on a weekday because weekends are super crowded. The parades are beautiful and the firework display is also not to be missed. You can access Disneyland from Tung Chung MTR and also bus stop is there.If you staying in the Disney hotels then the shuttle bus goes every 5 7 minutes. Even if you but tickets in advance and get the soft copy, you still have to queue up at the ticketing counter to get the entry pass.Look out on the Disney website for deals and discounts... the one day pass is for 539 HKD and i got a deal of 599 HKD for a 2 day pass.. so do remember to check for offers.There are plenty of restaurants and gift shops. Only during rush hours standing in the billing line at gift shop is a pain!Overall an enjoyable activity and not to be missed even if you going without a kid!"
2440,2019-7,"It only has a fraction of the rides that other Disney parks have, but they do it well, and the shows were spectacular. You can probably do the park in 1 2 a day, but you will be missing out on a few attractions. If you are only interested in thrill rides, then not the thing for you, but it is, if you want the full disney experience. "
2441,2019-7,First I must say I love Disney. Hong Kong Disney has the Disney feel and it wasn't crowded. This Disney park is very small and it caters to children 12 and under. There aren't any attractions for older children such as roller coasters and other fast rides. I walked around for 2 1 2 hours and rode the subway back to the hotel. I'm glad I went to Hong Kong Disney. 
2442,2019-7,"Its smaller than other Disney parks..but perfectly formed.I've been to Paris, Anaheim and Orlando and this was different but had plenty of disney magic.The ride on the MTR was the start with the ticket themed train, we visited just as the christmas season started and the tree lighting ceremony with snow was fabulous.Rounded off with the customary parade and fireworks..its a day which makes you feel good."
2443,2019-7,"Very nice place for not only children but adults too. Be there before 10 am so that you can enjoy as much as you can. As it is impossible to see all the shows and rides in 1 day so for 1 day ticket people go as early as possible. If you have more time you can buy ticket for 2 days. The gates open by 10 am. Take one umbrella if possible on sunny days summer specially. Nov to March is the best time to visit. If you have small kids and before taking any ride (specially quicker ones)you are not sure of do check with the guards as they will not tell you anything without asking. The food is good if you are non veg (eat specially beef and pork) not much for vegetarians. The prices of food inside are quite high. But at the end of the day its worth(try their bakery). Do not miss these shows and rides mentioned   Mickey and wondrous show, Hyper Space mountain ride,festival of lion king, its a small world(specially for kids) jungle cruise last but not the least is the fireworks at 7:30 pm."
2444,2019-7,No words to describe the feeling.... A dream come true for my children. We lived a magical and fantasy life for 2 full days. Love you Disney Land. A must visit for all parents who love to see smiles on their children's face
2445,2019-7,"This Park ist much of Fun for one Day!! Go not on the Weekend,better Monday Thursday.For all Age and People."
2446,2019-7,"Went to Disneyland Hong Kong again last November 2016. What can I say? There's just something about Disneyland that makes you feel like a kid again. Wife's eyes lit up as soon as the train to Disneyland arrived at the station.Let's begin with getting there. Getting to Hong Kong Disneyland is easy. Use the MTR. Just be prepared for a couple of train changes.For the tickets, we would recommend purchasing online to avoid the long queues. Just present the printed tickets or mobile vouchers at the turnstiles for a quick entrance.There are a couple of shows one shouldn't miss, the Festival of the Lion King and Mickey and the Wondrous Book. The production values for the Festival of the Lion King is awesome! Definitely worth a watch. Just be at the attraction 20 30 minutes before the show starts to get good seats.As for the rides, they were just okay. Not really that exciting. Understandably, most are geared for the younger kids.Food...lots of food venues. Most are catered for the Asian diet (rice, noodles, etc) but there are some Western dishes as well (burgers and steaks). Restaurants can get pretty crowded during lunch time so either eat early or late. Obviously, everything costs a lot more. A few dollars can be saved by buying a ticket with food package online.There are 2 parades, one at 3pm and the other at night. These are also cool. There was also a Christmas Tree lighting ceremony around 6pm. Mickey and the rest of the gang sang Christmas songs by the huge tree in Main Street.During our first trip years ago, a huge fireworks display would light up the sky around 8pm. This was accompanied by popular Disney tunes. Unfortunately, it rained a bit during our most recent stay so the show was cancelled.Disneyland Hong Kong does not compare to the other Disneylands. The park is smaller and the attractions are simpler. However, it's still an enjoyable experience for the kids and the kids at heart.By the way, avoid going during weekends and holidays. We went on a Friday and it wasn't so bad.Would we visit again? If it were just the wife and I, we'd probably skip it since we've already been there a couple of times. However, I'd take my son as soon as he's old enough to enjoy the place."
2447,2019-8,"This is an amazing place to spend a wonderful day. The train carriages to get you there were just beautiful. There were no long lines waiting to get in and the cost is very reasonable. The staff were very friendly but a few did not understand us. We spent all day there and stayed to see the night parade and fireworks which was well worth it. The night parade was even more spectacular than the afternoon one. There is an abundance of rides to choose from and everything is so colourful and clean. We went on a Tuesday and the children (and adults) no trouble at all getting onto all of the rides they wanted to. I think the children even went on some rides twice. Disneyland is not to be missed if you have children while in Hong Kong. A little tip   take water, the price they ask is ridiculously expensive. Places to eat are okay but nothing special."
2448,2019-8,"Thought things would be a bit more dramatic, i.e. 'Disney', but it was a little low key. Not many bigger rides either but fine for our 2 year old. Worth going but doesn't beat Florida or Paris."
2449,2019-8,It's really the happiest place in Hong Kong. We enjoyed all the activities and all the attractions and all the shows. i suggest you wait until the last parade and the fireworks display. its really magical! 1 day is not enough to visit all the attractions due to the line cue but its worth it!
2450,2019-8,"My first time to Disney here in Hong Kong. It was spotless and it was quiet thanks to the Disney in Shenzhen that opened. I would highly recommend this to anyone. the number of workers almost equal the number of visitors, absolutely no lines whatsoever, walked right onto each ride and was able to see the entire park in one day. Absolutely wonderful. I've been to the one in Florida and California and this was spectacular in comparison to them simply because there was no waiting and it's brand new."
2451,2019-8,"It is amazing how dated and run down the Disney brand has become.  Having visited DL in Paris, Florida and California I can say with certainty that this is the least enjoyable. It laxks the sparkle that the others do and is quite jaded."
2452,2019-8,"More like a big merchandising area with a few attractions for kids from 3 to 7 years. No real roller coaster, actually no attraction for people older than 12 at all. But my boys, 2 and 4, had fun. Queuing was OK, because it was off season. The rides mostly took les than 2 minutes, the time in between the rides was much longer... It wasn't painful, but if you expect a similar experience to european or US theme parks, then it is disappointing."
2453,2019-8,"Much smaller than Florida or California or Paris. MUCH smaller with fewer rides. However in some ways that's a positive   it was not mobbed with people, there were good facilities for food and drink, plenty of places to sit and relax. Overall a pleasant day."
2454,2019-8,"Favorite world for kids. Dream land must every child go to it. It's small Disney Land. Although, this doesn't change it's happy world for kids."
2455,2019-8,"unexpectedly very hot in mid November. wasn't prepared. but because it was not peak season, still made the most of the day although there are rides which are under maintenance. the parades are a sight to see! the shows as well."
2456,2019-8,"Not on the scale of Orlando but still plenty to do on a day's visit. It has the same magical atmosphere as Florida and an enjoyable day out for old, young and anyone in between."
2457,2019-8,"Came on sunday Was expecting long queues, but guess the newly openwd shanghai disneyland has pulled the crowds away. Making the place more pleasant and less crowded. If compared to tokyo this place seems second to that. The sense of feeling in disneyland is lmited to the main street Elsewhwere for the other worlds, we feel like in just some theme park. "
2458,2019-8,"I have never visited HK Disneyland as a child but this year, I went there with my cousins and was surprised to feel like an actual child again for a day. The rides are excellent. Expect to fall in line though, because this is a favorite tourist destination especially for families traveling with kids. The food available around Disneyland could be a bit pricey as well, especially in the restaurants. But the meals are decent and there's a lot to choose from. I think a meal with rice is around 200 HKD. Do not leave before the parade and fireworks though. It won't be a full experience if you miss it. The shows are great too! This place is perfect for relaxation but could be very crowded on weekends."
2459,2019-8,My third time at Disney park but my first with my daughter and hubby. Reserved a Minnie Mouse cake at Plaza Inn for my daughter's 7th birthday and they even gave her gifts! Disney staff gave stickers! Advisable to get 2 day park ticket. One day is not enough to enjoy the park. The Star Wars ride was crazy!!! We totally enjoyed our birthdays at Disney park HK! 
2460,2019-8,Great fun and a must see activity in Hong Kong.Suitable for all ages  Must attend all the shows (day and night)
2461,2019-8,"Having visited Disneyland Florida many years ago I was expecting a similair experience.Unfortunately Disneyland Hong Kong felt dated, basic & underwhelming.The characters were very professional and my 6 yr old daughter was pleased.This is a place for children under 10 yrs old offering little for teenagers or adults to enjoy.80 percent of the food halls were closed on our visit and the two we ate in were a nightmare. Aweful food, truly terrible, expensive and unclean."
2462,2019-8,"We had magical memories about this place. This is not just for kids but for adult too. Sadly, we didn't ride all the rides that was there because of long lines and we only have limited time. So we just rode the train that will let you see the whole disneyland. It was such a nice to remember       "
2463,2019-8,great place but do not rely on the staff for any information as they seem confused some of them  and u can miss out on important events there.
2464,2019-8,"I was traveling to HK on business and went to the park as a solo traveler. This is my first experience to a Disney park but I've been to Universal, Ferrari world, dream world etc. in comparison I thought this is more suitable for kids. Very few selective rides for adults. When you check the park map you see they have elaborated even little things like walk through snow whites castle, wishing well, fairy garden etc but actually there's nothing much to experience. I went there around 10 am and since I had e ticket my entry was easy. You have machines to get the ticket. By 3pm I had finished all different sections of the park and finished rides for adults. Hyperspace ride in tomorrow land and big grizzly mountain ride will give you adrenaline rush. Then there are some magical musical show with Mickey and few other like toy story parachutes fall. There's a ferry ride and visit to Tarzan's tree house which was so boring. I took adventure park boat ride and it is also recommended for kids. There's a train ride around the park which is good for you to get an idea of all attractions and how crowded they are. I couldn't do lion king concert since I had a flight to catch. At 3pm the parade started. It was short and only about 6 carriages and was over within 30 mins. I left after this but heard there are light shows in the night but I couldn't wait since I had a flight. But overall I thought you don't need full day for this park unless you have kids. You can either come at 10 and leave by 4 or come around 12 and stay back for night shows. It never extremely crowded. Queues were bearable. I went on a weekday so probably weekend could be different. I think this is good as a Disney theme park but it's very small so plan your day accordingly. Recommended for kids but not much for adults "

2466,2019-8,We went on a Friday and the park was practically empty until lunchtime.Castle is smaller and less imposing than Paris and Florida but in a very prefer backdrop.White knuckle rides are scarce but there are a couple that are good.The park is very very clean   cast members are friendly enough   not on the same scale as US cast members.Food is hopeless (same as all Disney parks)   overpriced and garbage but you know that before you go !Definitely worth a day there.
2467,2019-8,This theme park is amazing! DISNEYLAND. it has all the disney stuff you know and love aswel as all the characters and the new star wars areas and soon to open iron man experience. This is only a small park you will defiantly know the difference if you have ever been to florida disney. we went during the week and the lines were tiny it was great just walk on for all the rides! this is a must do if your in hong kong
2468,2019-9,"We had a magical holiday at the hongkong disneyland. We stayed at the disney hollywood hotel. We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. The hotel is plush with all modern amenities. Very nice ambience. This hotel does not have room service. Hence all meals have to be taken at the hotel's resturants. There are 3 of them. Chef Mickey (buffet resturant) is the best and serves limited indian dishes. It is also very expensive. One meal for 2 adults and one child can cost around 950 hkd. For those who savour non vegetarian food, chef mickey is a delight....the non veg spread is quite elaborate. The breafast at chef mickey is more economical. The indian vegetarian options are limited at breakfast as well. Infact it is the same daal makhani, steam rice, laccha paratha combination that you can expect during breakfast, lunch as well as dinner at chef mickey. We had one breakfast and one dinner at chef mickey. We tried out 2 dinners and one lunch at studio lounge ( ala carte resturant) at hollywood hotel. It offered the same indian vegetarian dishes as chef mickey but at half the cost (for 2 adults and 1 child). Each meal cost us around 500hkd at studio lounge. One thing we must mention, the daal makhani preparation at the hotel is simply amazing. It tastes like it has been prepared by any of the good restaurants in india.We had breakfast at enchanted garden (located at hotel disney land which is about 1 km away from hollywood hotel) for 2 days. Enchanted garden has charecter dinning with goofy pluto and mickey of course (as against chef mickey which only had mickey). Breakfast at Enchanted garden is slightly expensive than chef mickey. The breakfast spread at both enchanted garden and chef mickey is good (indian vegetarian). Daal makhani was there ( at both breakfast venues)!!The hotel does not have a shuttle that goes from hollywood hotel to disneyland hotel (the shuttles go from disneyland hotel to hollywood hotel to disney park to disneyland hotel) abd hence we had to walk around 1 km on both the days. The walk was pleasant though but with a small child becomes very slow. Hence please keep 20 mins grace if you are walking from hollywood hotel to enchanted garden. Meeting disney charecters at enchanted gardens is an awesome experience. We enjoyed it a lot. All the 3 charecters were very good and posed for photographs. The staff at enchanted gardens was very helpful.The disney park was an amazing experience as well. We had taken 2 day tickets. Covered all the rides we liked. Our daughter (3.5 years old) enjoyed winnie the pooh, phillar magic, dumbo the elephant, parachute drop, lion king, river safari and skinky dog. Grizzly gulch is a thrilling ride and we will not recommend it for children below 5 years. It has lots of jerks twists and turns at high speed. But a very thrilling ride for adults.Loved the experience at disneyland hk"
2469,2019-9,I visited with my wife after my son said to see the lion king show. We arrived just after 10am and after a bag check purchased tickets and went straight in . The park was everything you needed. Very clean lots of food choices and restrooms. My son was right the lion king show was awesome . As was the Mickeys story book. We stayed until the Christmas light turn on at 630pm .It was fantastic. We didn't stay for the fireworks because I was worn out . On leaving the park we noticed lots of people were just turning up. Probably for the fireworks. Hong Kong Disney is much smaller than Orlando but it was more enjoyable. All the staff in HK were excellent while the staff in Orlando seemed bored and rude. 
2470,2019-9,"We went to Disney with our 22 months granddaughter and her parents. We didn't go with any expectations as we understand from various review that there's no comparison with any other Disneys. It's good that we had this mindset because apart from the size of the park, there wasn't much Disney atmosphere. The exception was the parade which was one of the highlight. It shows that if they tried, they could capture the much needed Disney atmosphere. Anyhow, our granddaughter had a good time and that's good enough for us."
2471,2019-9,"After 4 years, want to feel young again but this time we brought our 3 children along to feel the same way. Then it is really true.. Disneyland is the happiest place on Earth.        The rides specially Grizzly Bear, Mystic Manor, story about Mickey's Book, Tea cups, Winnie the Pooh and Toy Story's parachute are my favorites. We got the 2 day tickets so you can just imagine we watched twice the day & night parade plus the amazing castle during the fireworks display. In my next bucket list, I will visit this place again either in Tokyo or Shanghai. "
2472,2019-9,"when i come there on sunday, the crowd is manageable although to take picture with Micky and Mini at the main street still have to wait long enough, the food taste so much better than my last visit years ago"
2473,2019-9,"Still smaller than California and Tokyo so there's a chance to tour the whole park in one day. Be sure to watch The Lion King, go on the Jungle River Cruise and meet Star Wars characters. The Iron Man Marvel Experience is opening soon so that's another attraction to look forward to."
2474,2019-9,"Great fun and at this time of the year (start of November) there were not that many queues. While this time of the year makes the weather perfect and the crowds much smaller, the open times are not long enough and ride that need a refurb are done at this time. The RC Racer was closed and the Autopia was gone, I assume to make room for the new Stark Ironman ride. Gates don't open until 10:30am and it closes at 7:30pm so it made it difficult to have dinner and continue on the rides."
2475,2019-9,"We went here in the morning and stayed until nighttime and I highly recommend you do that too but if you have leisure time or more time, you could go there for two days and you can save on the tickets if you plan on staying there for long. I highly recommend you to visit this place because every corner of the place is picturesque. The only downside is that the place is very large and it gets a little tiring to walk around but it is worth it. I also advise you to bring a small bag so that it won't be hard for you to walk around. Don't forget to stay until evening so that you can catch the marvelous fireworks display at around 7:30 (Hongkong time)."
2476,2019-9,"This Disneyland is smaller than the others but perfect for younger kids. Not too far to walk around. Lots of rides suitable for young kids. run and supervised. Go early on weekday and you won't have to queue too long for the rides. Also avoid local and Chinese school holidays. If you want to see the fireworks and you have young kids, i would suggest you get a 2 day pass, so you can go on separate days. We did that, and then upgraded to an annual pass and visited 4 times in one trip! Outside food,e.g. hot food, sandwiches, is not allowed. Snacks and water are OK. Bags are checked upon entry. There are plenty of dining options in the park, both Western and local foods"
2477,2019-9,If you are going to HK then Disneyland is a must see. Even if you dont have kids. They have enough shows to keep everyone interested. The parades are amazing and so is the fireworks. The photos with the characters are sure to cheer up kids and also adults. The lion king show and the 3d movie is quite well done and entertaining. You would need more than one day to enjoy the park. If you can then book at one of the hotels in disneyland for a night and make use of their 2 day pass. would feel a bit expensive but is absolutely worth it. Considering the parks in AU you get half the entertainment for double the price.Our whole family enjoyed our time at Disneyland and came back with lots of happy shops and souvenirs. absolutely amazing. 
2478,2019-9,"A school holiday treat for my 5 years old Son and he had a blast today the only set back was my Son was exhausted by 4pm, I had a blast too.."
2479,2019-9,Went here with a friends kids .  Had a great day out with many different rides etc.Easy to get around and very easy to get to on Train.
2480,2019-9,A great place for kids  Nice and clean environment  Good food available and have halal option  Staff is friendly  Downside is to little mickey and friend statue.. and we need to queue with other adult. Should have special section for kids only.
2481,2019-9,"Mickey   s PhilharMagic, Jungle River Cruise,Festival of the Lion King, Mickey and the Wondrous Book are the must see must try activities! These are the ones that are suitable for the very young to the very old! Queues for rides are not too long on a weekday, about 20min. But do arrive early for the shows as they are very popular!I got my tickets in HotelinHongKong.net, which were cheaper than the normal priced tickets! Require to show the e ticket at the counter to exchange for physical ticket."
2482,2019-9,"This is not my first time to Disneyland. I've been to the other older Disney when I was a kid. Now that I have my own kid, this Disney was the nearest to my hometown so I bring my toddler here. November is a good month to travel in HK, it was cool but sunny so it was really nice. Go during weekdays in low season like I did n there's less time you need to queu n more time to play. My toddler had a blast, everything was run professionally, the parade was okay. My toddler got picked up to dance with the fairies n she was so delighted. I prepared a Rapunzel costume for her to wear n she was beaming n feeling more princesslike during our time here. Why only 3 stars? During low season n weekdays so many of the restaurants n cafes are closed. So We are curbing our hunger with food fron the stalls such as hotdog, chicken leg, korean bbq squid n snacks like popcorn or mickey waffle. Not exactly the healthiest option but hey.. It is a vacation"
2483,2019-9,There was actually very little there  a few of the Disney classics but not too much else. It was an interesting visit but didn't require a lot of time. Several attractions were closed during my visit.
2484,2019-9,6 adults and 2 kids had a great time. A full days entertainment. There are a few adult rides but mostly caters for the younger. The street parade day and night are well worth seeing. The MTR delivered us from our motel in Kowloon direct to a Disney on Lantau Island . So well thought out 
2485,2019-9,"Easy to get to via metro, this was a highlight of our trip. We so wanted to visit on a not too hot day, so we can enjoy the whole day there without frying in the HK heatWe got our wish, and the day was perfect in every way. Don't get talked into transport, hotel pick up, blah, blah, blah. Their train system is superb, easy to navigate, and cheap. Hardly any waiting, you can move smoothly between any train transits, and before you know it you are there. From Kowloon district to Disneyland takes around 25 mins. There are regular trains back to where you need to go also. The resort is meticulously clean, with many rides on offer, to suit all ages. Plenty of seating and shade on offer, food to suit all budgets, with little pop ups here and there where you can purchase souvenirs, drinks, popcorn, etc. Please note you will be searched as you enter the venue. And no food is allowed to be taken in. Water is allowed. The venue was quite small, around the same size as our (Oz) Movie World. I was expecting more of an interactive experience, however we both really enjoyed the whole day. It was their special Halloween night. We did not stay cos the crowds were swelling hugely! In summary affordable, plenty of souvenirs to fill your packs, great food and service, colourful, and some really good rides, and a whole lot cheaper than flying to the real deal in US. I guess it is a good thing that we have not visited any of the other Disneyland venues. Nothing to compare it too. For a family I feel it is quite affordable, in these economic times. And using the public transport system will save you even more, while providing you with another view of everyday life for the locals. "
2486,2019-9,"Visited on a Tuesday and the park was very quiet. We got onto everything we wanted within 20 minutes, amazing. Have been to lots of other Disneys and this one ranks as my favourite"
2487,2019-9,"So I'll preface my review by saying I grew up while WDW was being built and have been more times than I can remember. Likewise I've had the opportunity to go to Disneyland California 8 10 times over the years. And a few years back visited Disneyland Paris.... so you might say I'm a semi Disney park fan ; ). This visit actually was a half day out of a 3 day weekend in Hong Kong, to make it 4 of 5 of the parks I've been to. So the above isn't to brag or anything, but to help you understand my perspective on The HK version. Getting to the park via special Disney MTR train was cool. Not overdone, but a nice tough. The MTR station in HK Disney was also themed to get you into the mood. Walkway and engrave area slowly pulled you in. I went in November and the crowds were very manageable, imagine in summer it's horrific though, although they seem well sized for big crowds. General layout was very similar to the spoke and wheel of the other Disney parks Magic Kingdoms, but looping from Adventure land around to Fantasyland was where it was most different. It was also where it was the most fun. My favorite ride was their version of Thunder Mountian Railroad (Big Grizzly), with a couple of, we'll call them,  twists . It was awesome, road it twice. The other was lost akin to Haunted Mansion (Mystic Manor) which is actually better to me (ride it twice too). Missing was Pirates of the Caribbean, which I think is unique for this park. There is no New Orleans. Other missing items had just different themed ones instead. Overall the park felt smaller the either D Cal or D Paris, but may not be. I was able to do all the rides I cared to (skipped all the ones in Fantasy Land except one and it took me 4 hours. For sure with bigger crowds it would take longer, but it gives a sense of the size. The Castle in particular was quite small, once you walk through it felt like 4 steps and you were out he other side. Wasn't very tall either, a bit of a disappointment. Food was interesting for a guy from the States. While there were burgers and such to be found, most restaurants served a heavily Asian based fare, go figure... in Hong Kong In the end I was glad I went, but given the opportunity again, I'm not sure I would. It was neat once but too few great rides like it seems the other parks have. I'm not digging on D HK, it is based on my previous experiences as I mentioned previously. If you haven't been I absolutely suggest you go, you'll have a great, no Magical, time. "
2488,2019-10,"What can I say I loved my visit, it's great, just as magical as other Disney parks, although it's more cutesy then grand and over the top! I went on a week day, the crowds so small, I wait no more then ten min to get onto any ride. At first you may think there is not a lot to do,but it's definitely a full day, I was too relaxed thinking I'd have more time then attractions, but once I made a plan around the shows and parades, I was left scrambling and squeezing every second I had to finish the rides and eat! lol I have been to every Disney property, except the new one in China, I love the uniqueness of HK Disney, but I must confess I'm left wondering what's with the scale of the castle? It's a bit of a let down, it's very odd, still very pretty but it should be a highlight, it's almost lost, I wonder about how that design came to be! Thank You For a great experience!! "
2489,2019-10,"This was a great way to spend a day. Not as exciting as it's America counterpart, not really exhilarating rides here. There are a few good rides. Not as big as the USA Disney land. No need for lockers as you can take you belongings with you. "
2490,2019-10,As far as disney parks outside the US I like this one the best.  It's small enough and also updated rides are good.  Missing some of the original park rides like Matterhorn and Thunder Railway though.
2491,2019-10,Had great fun at Disney with my two daughters and wife. The kids really loved being there and thoroughly enjoyed the whole day.
2492,2019-10,"This is my 4th Disneyland (after LA, Orlando & Tokyo). This time of the bring not a peak season, is a good time visit Disneyland. Crowd manageable, most rides max 5 10mins waiting time, not too crowded watching the parades, weather not cold Nor hot. Managed to complete 80% of all rides, shows and Parks by 3pm. Only setbacks were most restaurants were not open and staff not very friendly. This Disneyland is not very big compared to the 3 others which I had visited. Also most rides are suitable for the younger ones."
2493,2019-10,"Much smaller scale than Disney World (no surprise there) but such high quality! Something I really enjoyed is that there are certain rides attractions here that you cannot find at the other Disney parks. I would say this should not be the TOP thing on your Hong Kong To Do List, since it is not a natural part of the Hong Kong culture, but if you have the time to squeeze it in, it was very enjoyable!"
2494,2019-10,"no queue's like USA..... lots of Characters in all area's of the park, great Hot Dogs..... The Halloween decorations and parade were fab. the MTR is a cheap and fast mode of transport and takes you directly into the park."
2495,2019-10,"Awesome day out but massive lack of characters. We had read this in the reviews so had pre booked breakfast at the Enchanted Garden. Glad we did as breakfast was great and had one on one with Mickey, Minnie, Pluto and Goofy. Didn't see them at the park at all. Didn't see one princess. Very disappointing! But other than that a great day out. Ride lines not too bad, MTR there was easy!Highly recommend but definitely do the breakfast before hitting the park. HUGE buffet and high quality. "
2496,2019-10,"First, the transportation to HK Disneyland was very good. Our trip was on a Thursday which might be why it was not that crowded as we were dreading it to be. It was a sizeable crowd still but the lines   queues were manageable. The attraction was great. The parade and the fireworks was just funtastic! The only theme park we were not able to visit was the Mystic Point but our 4year old had a blast with Princess Elsa and Anna. Also had her picture with Buzz Light Year. The shows were also very entertaining like the Lion King and Mickey Mouse (  Donald Duck's) magical show. Our daughter loved the Donald Duck's show very much.The food was on a high side but we thought it was reasonable compared to the other HK attracion (OP). The serving was nice at the Star Liner. Three meals would have been enough for us 4 Filipinos of 3 adult and 4 yo.I was worried about the transportation after the fireworks given the big crowd but the MTR was very efficient. Wow. I have been making reviews and  MTR was very efficient  was always in it. It was just great.We will be returning to HK Disneyland for sure. Maybe make it a 2 day next time and just forego with the other theme park down south. "
2497,2019-10,I have been to all the disneys now. I went on tuesday and there was not a huge crowd so I was able to get on all the rides with minimum queing. Dont go on a weekend? Take a bottle of water with you its 30 HK dollars inside lol but as expected everything is pricey. The fireworks and light show was a highlight but get to the centre early for best views.
2498,2019-10,Young and young at heart will definitely enjoy this! My son super enjoyed the Astro Blaster attraction.
2499,2019-10,"it was a great place for kids and the young at heart, we like thrill rides and there is 2. very expensive to eat but people seem really enjoy it"
2500,2019-10,"Spent the whole day here. The miners ride was great. The live shows,the lion king and storybook were well worth seeing. Very professionally done and performers excellent. No queues made the day even better"
2501,2019-10,"We went here as a couple and sans kiddos. We had a blast. We ate terrific food, rode some classic rides, and played all day. A much smaller version of Disney World but so amazing and wasn't disappointed at all."
2502,2019-10,It   s an institution that needs visiting at least once. The atmosphere is awesome. People really get into it wearing family matching t shirts. Rides are great for all ages. Prepare to line up for ages and you will enjoy yourself. Rest rooms were plentiful and clean. Food choices good. Shows awesome. Loved it
2503,2019-10,"So the review is a bit dated, but hope it will help someone. We went for Thanksgiving week and while it was crowded, we had a great time visiting both the parks and Downtown Disney, the only thing that was not fun was the line to get thru security at either end....since we never left the area, we got screened a lot, but safety needs to be first. Just hard to explain it to a 6 and 3 year old about the wait times and wanding at the entrances."
2504,2019-10,"Whether you dream of traveling there , or just watching Disneyland Forever fantastical fireworks display, pack your bags and simply go. Each attraction is a  unique discovery.  In case of teens please do avoid getting drunk before entering Space Mountain!"
2505,2019-10,"what can I say every kids dream to go to Disneyland. it so much fun when your young going on the rides and seeing the parades. so much to do here, but make sure you get a early pass to beat the lines on all the rides and another tip stay close to the park too save money on parking. "
2506,2019-10,Disneyland is one of those things that you can't possibly make justice while trying to verbally describe it. I've been to the park with family members ranging from 2 to 65 years old and the magic happens to everyone. If you are in California (with kids or not) you should stop and spend a day.
2507,2019-10,I dream of coming to Disneyland since I was little. I never had a chance until now and it was way too pricey and way too crowded. I even got the fast past but it's still at least 1 hour wait for certain attractions. I think my dream died a little because it's not as magical for adults!! LOL 
2508,2019-11,"Disneyland is not far from where I live. Therefore, we go there quite often. It's a great place to go any time of the year, but Christmas time is the prettiest. Food can be pricey, so we step outside and eat at any of the restaurants in Downtown Disney. It's a great place for families to visit."
2509,2019-11,"Who doesn't love Disney? We have a great time, enjoying every ride, taking pictures with caracters, and do whatever you have to do in the happiest place on earth"
2510,2019-11,"I visited prior to a conference and had a great time. Because many of the older rides are not up to ADA code, they allow handicapped individuals to check in and obtain a return time (similar to Fastpass), which was helpful to my travel partnr. The reason that I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is that the cast member with Goofy at a Meet and Greet disappeared, so we had no one to assist with photos as the guests before us had. Also, as a repeat visitor to WDW, I didn't feel as much of the  magic,  particularly from cast members, as I typically do at WDW. Nevertheless, Disneyland is still a must see."
2511,2019-11,I don't know where to begin but all I know is that every time I've been to America I've been to Disneyland. I am a bit biased being a true Disney fan but this is definitely my happy place. I can go here again and again and still never want to leave when it's time to go. There's something for everyone and it gives everyone the chance to be a kid again.
2512,2019-11,"There is so much to see and do and the fast pass option is fantastic. The original and my sentimental favorite. The parades are a must and my advise is to find a position early and stick with it. Fireworks are incredible and another must see. Peter Pan ride is one of the most popular rides but doesn't have fast pass so the best option is to go there first thing or during a parade or fireworks.With the Buzz Lightyear ride, where you shoot your lazer at certain targets, don't forget to email the photo that's taken during the ride. You'll find this after you get off the ride but before you enter the shop.If you have small children who love Star Wars, then sign up for the Jedi training as they will learn to battle the dark side while you can watch and end at Tomorrowland Terrace. I could go on and on, but you'll soon discover this for yourself. Make sure you have more than one day as there is so much to see and do."
2513,2019-11,"I have a two year old son. They have enough rides to keep him busy for a full day of fun. He loved seeing Mickey mouse! The food was good priced high but expected for Disney. We ate at Blue Bayou and they offered a great selection. Seemed to be the most food for your money and located in a great are to relax away from all the people. They do offer a toddler area if you need a quiet place to feed, change, or tend to a young child. We went to the area located in the front of the park. The smiles from my two year old was well worth the money to go."
2514,2019-11,"We visited Disneyland on Thanksgiving which I think was probably one of the busiest days at the park. Since we don't celebrate this holiday in Australia I don't think we quite understood its significance. The park is open from early about 8am until midnight. It is has been one of my dreams to visit Disneyland ever since I was a child and watched the wonderful world on a Sunday night. Being a fan of theme parks I was excited to go to the original and it was the best. Granted it was quite expensive to get in nearly $300 for a two day pass, but it is extremely well run. The staff were excellent and so friendly, engaging with guests. The park was pristine there was no litter anywhere and if a parade had confetti it was cleaned up straight after. The food was reasonable in price and they had plenty of fountains to refill your water bottles. It was very crowded though I think that had a lot to do with the holiday and there was long lines to go on the most popular rides. The rides were worth the wait, unlike rides at Australian theme parks, they go for a long time and are the product of a lot of imagination. We went on Space Mountain, the Indiana Jones ride, Pirates of the Caribbean, two boat rides, one that went through miniature villages of Disney movies including Aladdin & Frozen and a jungle one that went past different animatronic animals. We also went on the famous teacups which was part of my childhood dream though the more you spin the faster they go which leads to dizziness! There are lots of people that go to Disneyland and it seems like many families make it part of the annual vacations, with families wearing matching shirts, with their names, well, Mum, Dad, Nanna, little brother and big sister etc on them. There were also a lot of people in wheelchairs and mobility scooters, that you can hire at the park. I'm not entirely convinced that all the people using these facilities were actually disabled as those with mobility issues get priority in the lines and take along their family of 10 people along, so it seemed to me that it was a sneaky way to not have to wait in the queues, which at times were over an hour wait. If you are staying at the Disney Resort there is a complimentary fast pass, that allows you to jump the queue for each ride, but if you want to go again are given a time at which to return, which is fair enough.We enjoyed the parade & waited nearly 3 hours for the fireworks over the castle which was then cancelled due to the wind, though it was not really that windy. That was most disappointing as our feet were sore after a big day walking around, and if we knew that there was going to be no fireworks we would have gone to either the laser show at the California Adventure park which is the sister park or gone back to our accommodation.We caught the ART bus there which was $5.50 per adult for 1 day, of $14 for 3 days. It was a good way to get around Anaheim and the drivers were excellent, the lady on our way there helped a lady in a wheelchair onto the bus, she was very professional.I was so happy to be able tick this off my bucket list and I would highly recommend it to anyone thinking of visiting the wonderful world of Disney."
2515,2019-11,"This was our first time visiting. Awesome rides. Great activities. Amazing events and shows. Lots of memories. The park was well maintained. Definitely this is the happiest place on earth. All my kids (12, 7, 3) had very good time and they wanna go back.Know how to use the Disney App, FastPass & Rider Switch before you get there. You will enjoy more!!"
2516,2019-11,"Our 3rd trip here and it was fantastic as always.My husband's first time. He didn't grow up watching Disney and though Disney was a scam just to take our money.I convinced him to join us. I gave him the option of leaving and going back to the hotel for a beer anytime he liked. He stayed all day all three days and said he would come again.Disney is expensive, it can be crowed, and it is a lot of walking.But Disney is Disney! All they do is over the top! It's clean, landscaping out of this world, and theming always more than you expect. It truly is magical!"
2517,2019-11,"It's Disneyland, what more can I say? It gets better with each visit. You don't even mind when some rude teenagers butt in front of you."
2518,2019-11,Disney is just amazing. Definitely prioritize what you really want to see because there is just never enough time to do it all.
2519,2019-11,"The only reason for me not to give this place a 5 star score is that I will keep that score to DisneyLand Tokyo. Still is the most magical place you could ever found youself in while inside the USA, the sounds and sights and even the smells of popcorn and cotton candy makes of DisneyLand a place to visit at least once in your life if possible with family. In all the park has great rides, on stage shows, parades and fireworks but it suffers a bit from being the original park some areas are a bit confusing sometimes due the layout and expansions. But you can only notice these things if you are a Disney Park aficionado, otherwise this will be perfection.Please, avoid holidays and school vacations at all coast! "
2520,2019-11,"Having come from Disneyworld, it's definitely smaller than Orlando's Magic Kingdom. But still as magical. You can do both parks in 1 day, but would recommend getting a 2 day pass as you can do disneyland in one day, but you need more time for California Adventure."
2521,2019-11,"Went to park during extra hour before park opens to general public. Lined up well in advance. Went right to Peter Pan ride. Managed to go through half of park, and see all characters photos autographs for 5 year old within about 7 hour trip. Download app as shows where characters are and ride times, in real time. Used fast pass for space mountain and Indiana Jones rides."
2522,2019-11,"Visited Disneyland solo to celebrate my 50 th. It was a magical, wonderful experience. I surprised myself in that I pretty much did all the rides. I did not feel intimidated or lonely as people chatted in the lines as we waited for the ride. ( I think they were fascinated by my story of travelling from Australia solo leaving my Hubble and kids at home)It is truely the happiest place in the world. I could not wipe the smile from my face all day and throughout the evening. The Christmas de orations and shows were equally amazing. I am so happy I got to experience at the tender age of 50"
2523,2019-11,"Rides are fine; place is clean but it's a big corporation looking to get the most money from you for the least amount of work. There's no good time to come here. If there are fewer customers, they reduce their staff. Sadly, customers are second class. It would be so bad if the trucks today. I'd understand if it was $30 per person and you had to wait online for 40 minutes, and sometimes two hours. But the they charge so much to get in that there should be better service."
2524,2019-11,"We spent 2 days at the park. Me, husband and 5 year son. The first day we went to the  original  Disneyland side. The second day we went to the newer side (Cars land). Disneyland is SO busy! Crowds. Line ups. Expensive. Yes we had fun. But waiting 1.5 hours in line for a 10 minute ride is not fun. We tried to take advantage of the Fast passes (you HAVE to use these to actually get on any rides!!!). Still... your best bet is to plan midweek during low season to come here. And come early. And plan the order of rides to go on. We liked the original Disneyland side much better than the new one. If we come back we would just do the original side. More rides and options. And   sigh  since our son is only 5, I see more Disneyland trips in our future...."
2525,2019-11,"We love visiting Disneyland.  Hyperspace mountain, Big Thunder Mountain, and the Yeti roller coasters are our favorites.  Peter Pan always has a crazy long line.  Dumbo is a classic!"
2526,2019-11,"It's Disneyland the happiest place on earth, what else can I say, for this quote hits me true by heart esp when I am visiting it as me not as mommy me. Food: Ok, yes it could be really expensive but there are ways to be economical by not eating at sit restaurants like the Blue Bayou but more value meal like Turkey legs that is actually could be good for two people.Wait Times: Yes it can be long, but utilizing the Fast Passes is a good wait to help with that issue. Or if is plausible to your schedule come on a weekday (middle of the week) like Tuesday thru Thursday "
2527,2019-11,"Our family visited in November, and we found that the queues were short with hardly any waiting time at all. There were no queues at the front gate, which surprised us, and we went straight in. It was everything we expected, and more. We arrived late morning, and stayed into the night to see the fireworks and the castle light up. Absolutely fantastic. Most importantly the kids had a wonderful time. Plenty of different foods and snacks are available, with places to sit and eat. We all enjoyed the rides and meeting the various characters who were walking about   and they were available for free photos (to take yourself). By visiting in November, we saw the whole Park in one day, and managed to go on some of the rides twice, because of no waiting time. For anyone who has difficulty walking about, there are mobility scooters available for $60 per day, down near the front entrance. The people who rent the scooters will find that there are areas for parking them, outside the rides, so there's no problem with missing out on any rides they want to go on. We went there by local bus from out hotel, and it was easy to find the bus home, in the designated bus area just outside the Park. All in all, Disneyland does its best to make sure everyone has a happy and fun day. I'd definitely suggest staying into the night, if you can, because the whole place is lit up and looks fantastic, plus you see the fireworks and the wonderful castle light show   which had everyone in the crowd gasping because it was so beautiful. By arriving in the late morning, we probably missed some of the early morning queues too, and we still managed to see everything and to get on every ride we wished to go on. And there was still time for souvenir shopping in the night before we left for home. Thanks Disneyland for a great experience!"
2528,2019-12,"We made our first trip to Disneyland in November. Having been to WDW many, many times, it was strange how familiar, yet, different the park seemed compared to Magic Kingdom. I absolutely had a blast on my visit, but the things at Disneyland are not up to par with Disney World. To me Disneyland seems kind of rundown and second rate compared to all of the parks at Disney World and California Adventure for that matter. That being said, the nostalgic feel of the park, and the family atmosphere were wonderful. The guests who visit DL seem to be a family, and I loved that. Being in the original park that Walt built was very special to our group, because we are what you might call,  Disney People,  and as you know if you are a Disney Person, Walt's vision has made an impact on our lives. Being at this park just feels different than the others in that way.The rides and attractions here are great. DL's Space Mountain is light years better than Magic Kingdom. The Matterhorn was a once in a lifetime experience that I would not care to repeat, but I will do anything once! Nemo's submarine was also an interesting ride, if not claustrophobic ride. Our other favorite DL ride was Indiana Jones. Oh my, was that a fun one! We were also able to ride Haunted Mansion Holiday, which is very cool, especially for Nightmare Before Christmas fans. I am not a huge fan of the movie, but the overlay is phenomenal. The food here is fantastic. We ate at Jolly Holiday twice, and at the Market in New Orleans Square. Both were really delicious and not outrageously priced. All in all, I can't wait to go back one of these days and experience it again. I would like to take a little more time next trip, but being our first trip to Cali, we had other things to see as well! I feel like I only skimmed the surface of what Disneyland has to offer in my four days spent in both parks."
2529,2019-12,What must I say? A youth dream came true. It is a suitable experience for young and old. A must when you are in California.
2530,2019-12,"Walk around and went on rides all day long , stayed in terribly long queues and not once did we see characters such as Mickey or Minnie or any other characters for that matter , children were very disappointed."
2531,2019-12,"We had a great couple of days here. Always lots to see and do. So glad we avoided the weekend, we managed to do every ride!"
2532,2019-12,"This truly is the happiest place on earth bar none. Everything is amazing and coming from Australia, we can't believe how big the parks were. Waiting in line for an hour and still enjoying the ride is something unheard of in Australia. We went for the 4 day pass and it was solidly packed each day. We utilised the lockers to store our jumpers as the nights were a bit cooler especially for the kids. Limited rides have fast passes but make sure you get them if you can as it does save a lot of time. Each fast pass can be taken about an hour apart (sometimes more) so make sure you plan out carefully which ride you want to go first. The turkey leg near Matterhorn is a must have as it is just so tasty and tender. Another tip, the  gourmet  hotdogs is just a plain hotdog so don't get conned into it."
2533,2019-12,As we are from Australia we did not realise that the whole week is a holiday for Thanksgiving. Disneyland was ridiculously busy. DO NOT GO DURING THE WEEK OF THANKSGIVING. Saying that I would like to say that the staff handled the mass of people rather well. Staff were continually making sure the crowds kept moving and organising pram parking bay and guiding people during parades. Would recommend making the most of the fastpasses and get there on gates open if going during a busy time. Ignoring the crowds my visit to Disneyland was as amazing. Completed the dream I have had since I was little.. only problem is I know what to go back!
2534,2019-12,"Disneyland Park and California Adventure Park are facing each other. You may not distinguish which is which, but no question about it, as they say, Disneyland is the happiest place on earth...no, it's not Las Vegas..."
2535,2019-12,"Our family just spent five days here and as usual it's as good of an experience as you can expect from Disney. It continues to be the Happiest Place on Earth. Other than the park being extremely crowded on our last day, there are no complaints. "
2536,2019-12,In Australia we don't have anything like Disneyland. We do have theme parks but nothing at all like what I experienced here. I am not going to lie I had the best time. But honestly you do need more than one day to experience all the wonders this place has to other let alone both of the lands here. The lines are long and there is a lot of people so downloading their line waiting times on there app really helps. You can even get express bands that let u skip the lines if u have limited time. If your a fan of pirates of the Caribbean movies I would definitely recommend to do the ride. The wait is worth it. Some of the characters will be roaming around the park others have there houses that they will be at at certain times that u can get photos with. If u are an adrenaline seeker pop over to adventure land and go on the scream coaster. You will know which one it is. The massive one behind the ferries wheel. When u stay in one of the park hotels as well the u can walk directly into the park from your hotel and you will get in 1 hour before the public is let in daily. Definitely stay for the firework display.
2537,2019-12,"Before I get into the meat of my review I would like to say that I was raised on Disneyland CA. No place has ever reached my heart the way this magical place has. With much to my despair I'll have to disclose the following. I have been to all the Disney parks around the world except for the ones in China. Disneyland CA although the original, is slipping dramatically in regards to customer service, crowd control, and overall appearance. I believe a lot has to do with the multitude of crowds being packed into a small acreage of land. But my biggest disappointment on my last visit in Nov. 2016 was definitely with the customer service. It could be that Disneyland CA may have limited options available when hiring adequate personnel but it obviously seems that the employees  cast members  are not happy working at what is supposed to be the happiest place on earth. It breaks my heart to say this. I always put Disneyland at the top when it came to the friendliness of it's  cast members . Unfortunately that is not the case anymore. My last visit I found many of the cast members rude, unpleasant, and overall uncaring about delivering the Disney brand. Now with that being said I'll also have to add that a lot of the guests there were not very pleasant either. This sense of entitlement that everyone seemed to have staggered me.The upkeep of the park was below par. Hopefully the new expansion of the Star Wars land will allow more room for the multitude of people who visit. Or it could possibly make matters worse. I'm crossing my fingers that things will turn around for Disneyland CA. NOTE TO GUESTS: Remember when you go to Disneyland you're there to have fun. Not to act like you own the park. It's OK to be a kid again just don't act like a spoiled one. Be courteous to fellow park goers!"
2538,2019-12,"This place is always magical, it doesn't matter how old you are. It was 30 years since my first visit, with a few visits in between, but still so magical. It's even more special when it's dressed up for Christmas     "
2539,2019-12,"I've been to Disneyland (and California Adventure) a number of times over the years, mostly with my kids. If I'd rated them, I'd have given all prior visits a 5. I really do fall for that  happiest place on earth  motto. This latest trip (4 1 2 days with kids and their friends) was peculiar. By the end of our trip, we were up to 10 fails on attractions. And by fail, I mean standing in line for a half hour or more and then having the attraction closed due to problems. 10 times! That's a lot of disappointment for over $300 per person worth of tickets. And experiencing so many ride closures made me realize that Disney is not very good about handling them. No good announcements that can be heard by everyone in line. No easy way to exit lines when things close. Very poor management of Fast Pass vs regular folks when ride throughput dropped precipitously. Having marveled at how good Disney is with people flow, I was quite taken aback by how badly it broke down when things went awry. But 3 is harsh. I love the parks during the holidays   the festive decorations add a magical touch. And I'll no doubt return in spite of this experience. But Disney needs to improve the reliability of their attractions and figure out how to better handle the crowds when things break down."
2540,2019-12,This was our second trip to Disneyland in 8 years and we enjoyed it a lot more now that the kids are older.
2541,2019-12,"Be sure to get there at least half hour before the gates open.Look out for queue that are shorter line because the crowd there don't really care about waiting long unnecessarily. Night time was lovely, but some areas need more lighting as it seem very dark, so can be unsafe for young children.Staff were ok, some were too 'commanding', not so customer friendly.Overall great experience, just avoid the peak period or summer as much as possible. Else you are simply wasting 80% of your time there queueing in line for the rides attractions."
2542,2019-12,"Remember to pace yourself! Remember that you don't have to do everything! Disneyland always feels so big and sometimes a little overwhelming, especially with a 4 YO and a sometimes cranky husband. I often have to remind myself, while standing in line, that it's OK not to do everything. My recommendation is to spend the night at one of the Disney Hotels and enjoy the Parks at your own pace. Giving each of your family members a break. Maybe try to visit during off times and during the week."
2543,2019-12,I always walk through Disneyland worry free and with a smile on my face. Just a walk down main street can take my stress away. For some this might not be your thing but I love watching the crowds and seeing the reaction of peoples faces to the happenings around
2544,2019-12,"The holiday time is a great one to go, the park is just perfectly decorated for christmas. Big crows and traffic jams but still worth it."
2545,2019-12,"This theme park is amazing, all rides are amazing and staff is always kind! Went by myself and had the time of my life!"
2546,2019-12,"I've been to Disneyland every single year at least once since 1955, the year it opened. It's magical. Let's face it, it's not cheap but there is something magical about seeing the looks on kids faces as they see the characters they watch everyday on television. It's a magical place for young and old. I prefer Disneyland over Disney World for those under 12. Disney World is sooooooo spread out kids are exhausted before they even leave one theme park. It's too much. Disneyland California Adventure is much smaller and the area compact so you're not walking as far. There are some excellent restaurants at Disneyland?California Adventure. I would recommend Blue Bayou by Pirates of the Caribbean, Napa Rose in the Grand Californian Hotel, and Carthay Circle Restaurant in California Adventure. All are fine dining and require reservations. You can call the Disney Dine Line for reservations 60 days in advance. I suggest you do it between 50 and 60 days in advance if you are serious about eating there."
2547,2019-12,"This was our first trip to Disneyland. Since we're from the east coast Disney World is where we tend to go. Disneyland is feels much smaller and the castle is really small; most of the rides are the same, but usually slightly different. That may sound negative, but that's the reason we wanted to visit Disneyland, to see what was different, original. It was well worth it. We were with our teens and in 1 day were able to see and ride everything at least once, some more than once. "
