121,2016-1,"We went to Universal over Memorial Day weekend and it was a total train wreck. We waited to get in the parking lot for about forty minutes. We paid for prime parking to make up for all the wasted time.  Then we paid extra for the express pass 2-park tickets only to be turned away and sent to guest services bc the app didn’t show the bar code. The line at guest services took forever. They are clearly understaffed. We were sent to yet another guest services line because we had the express passes! Also took ages! We spent nearly 2 hours just trying to enter the park! When we shared this with Jackie at guest services she smirked, didn’t even apologize and was patronizing. This would never happen at Disney.  Once inside several of the rides didn’t work, when they reopened they were backed up so the express line on some rides was still a FULL HOUR wait and two hours without the express pass! We also saw people jump over and sneak in to the express lanes and then convince the workers to just let them on if there was a check point and it worked. We felt like complete suckers for paying for the express pass that still left us in long lines and that other people who didn’t pay could just sneak in to.  There were long lines to buy water, to use a restroom, to get a butter beer- it sucked.  Horrible day. Avoid this place, it’s a total disaster!"
122,2016-1,The food service is horrible. I’m not reviewing the food. It’s the wait time!!!! 45 minutes minimum to get to the one cashier working at each place. Ruins the whole experience. 5 closed cash registers.
123,2016-1,"I booked this vacation mainly to ride Hagrid motorcycle adventure; very disappointing to find out the only way to ride it is through ""Virtual line"". I've spent my entire vacation trying to find a spot, but always got the same message ""No virtual line times left"". It seems very strange to me how suddenly the ride changes from 30 minutes wait, to no virtual line times left. I strongly believe that whoever is responsible for running this virtual line, is actually prebooking all the times available throughout the day to whoever they want to. Costumer services is very poor to say the least, and clearly not only doesn't care to address my complaints, but also very unapologetic, defiant. It's true what I've heard ""we are not in Disney, we don't have to be nice"". Every time we wanted to eat in any location at any park, there was always a huge line waiting to be served or seated. All 3 parks were filthy, trash everywhere. This review probably will not make any difference to Universal, probably won't get to be read at all. Some agent I was chatting with already said it when I told them I was considering not coming back, he/she simply said ""No problem!"" At least I get to express my feelings based on my experience. Hopefully it will be helpful to a potential guests."
124,2016-1,"When a person tries the test seat for the rides, and gets the green light, they should not have to go through a long line just to be turned away because the ride operators say they can't get in the actual seat. And giving out express passes to the group does not rectify that situation."
125,2016-1,"Ok, I can't stress enough to anyone and everyone... if you go to Universal Studios Orlando... make sure you take the time to go see The Bourne Stuntacular...I had to watch it 3xs and it wasn't enough. I never knew who Jason Bourne was... but now I will be buying the movies. This was absolutely awesome, amazing and 100% worth the entire cost of the trip by itself. So worth the wait and every time I went it was packed. I would have passed it up thinking it was nothing WRONG!!!! ...DONT MISS THIS!!!!"
126,2016-1,Worst experience I have ever had the rides are outdated the whole place smell like vomit where ever you go theres long waiting times the staff are super disrispectfull at restorants especially bubba camp the manager and staff are super rude disrespectful uncaring. This isn’t a vacation
127,2016-1,"I just expected more. Alot of waiting around, lack of staffing and over priced tickets for what you actually get. They wanted over $700 bucks for a cabana at Volcano Bay! The express passes were close to $150.00 bucks. They need to take lessons from Disney as they seem to have the crowd control down. City Walk was just a bunch of kids hanging out all night. Just Eh. It's been 15 years since my last visit and now I know why."
128,2016-1,"This was my 4th trip with my daughter to Universal and unfortunately my most disappointing. Most of which had nothing to do with Covid restrictions. We stayed on-site at the Hard Rock and of course had the fast passes. At the time of our stay May 18-22 there was no housekeeping at all. All trash and used towels were left in the hallway and a phone call had to be made for fresh towels. So walking down the hallway to dirty towels and trash wasn't the most pleasant experience. Hotel aside my biggest complaints were the crowds and long lines for the rides and food. Fast passes were of course not available on the newer attractions, so 1 hour plus waits for those rides. Most other rides were about 1/2 the wait time. Most sit down restaurants in the park and at city walk had no walk up times and reservations were few and far between. Make sure you make them well ahead of time as there was limited seating. Take out at the food court at city walk was well over an hour. They were well under staffed (3 employees at Moe's) and the line was far out the door. The area was dirty and the trash was overflowing. It just appears as Universal is not prepared for the crowds they are letting in. I guess we just expected more for the money we spent. We love Universal, but I am very leary about coming back anytime soon."
129,2016-1,"Universal is one thing - Not Disney. Everything Disney does well Universal dues poorly. We arrived just before opening (9 AM) and exited our car in the marking deck. We were met with a line so long it went from security, all the way across 2 bridges and circled back on itself 4 times in the marking deck. After an hour we realized the line was not really being enforced and people were going around so we followed a small crowd up closer and still had another 1/2 hour wait to get in. There were NO employees helping to direct traffic or people. I asked an employee once we got through security and they simply said that they were not limiting the parks and that they were extremely short staffed. Only about 1/3 of the employees had been hired back but the crowds were overwhelming them.  The rest of the day went about the same. 1 hour for coffee. 1.5 hours to get food. We managed to ride ONE ride in 7 hours and finally left due to frustration.  Not much changes. If you have been before don't waste your time. For the first time Harry Potter fans its interesting to walk around and shop but good luck doing much. 90+ minutes to ride the hogwarts express.  They did have mask policies but no one was around to enforce them so what was the point? They had hand sanitizer stations but I did not find a single one with anything in it. They clearly care about $$ and not guests or employees. I won't be back and I'd take a Disney park (which were below capacity and a great experience for less $$) any day."
130,2016-1,"We spent 6 nights on site at Sapphire Falls as a family of 6 (2 adults, 4 kids age 5-14) with a 4 day park hopper pass. We did not get the express pass, but if you want to do rides and aren't there for four days, I don't know how you would experience this park without them. The early park admission didn't do much as only Universal Studios offered it during the days we were there. This ended up being the busiest times of Wizarding World throughout the day and the longest line at the gate. We did Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure Thursday, Friday, Sunday, and Monday to avoid the Saturday crowd. Sunday was the lightest day with regard to crowds.  The theme park did a great job of immersion in the lines and having a little something for everyone. If you are pregnant or are prone to motion sickness, you will struggle to find rides you can do. Our little ones loved Fieval's playland and Dr. Seuss Landing. They also enjoyed the Men in Black Ride. Our older kiddos, who were new to theme parks and coasters, enjoyed a varied array of rides and shows. Animal Antics show was ok- Indianapolis zoo has one similar but much better. Bourne Stuntactcular was amazing. The Ripsaw falls and Popeye's barge were a hoot.  Wizarding World was quite neat. So well done to every fine detail. Unfortunately, employees don't seem to get that memo and ruin the ""magic"" a bit. Gringotts and Hagrid's were amazing rides. Worth the wait. We found Gringotts rarely had a line around 10am after the initial early entrance arrivals went through. Hagrid's line went down the lowest around noon (45 minutes).  We had a lovely time and it was a memorable vacation. Here are a few things to keep in mind or I wish Universal would improve on:  --I don't think I encountered any ""above and beyond"" employees. Most seemed annoyed that guests were in the park. I felt like a stone in their shoe rather than a guest. It was a rare occurrence to get a friendly wave as we entered or left a line.  --Breakfast at the Three Broomsticks was absolutely horrendous (we had breakfast tickets with our package). The girl's pancakes were stale as though they had sat for a couple hours under a heat lamp. It took almost 20 minutes after being seated for someone to come to our table and the place was mostly empty. My eggs were obviously some powdered version and were barely edible. Once the food was delivered, no one came by to refill drinks or ask us about our food. Thankfully, the food and experience at the Leaky Cauldron was 100% better.  --The ""quick service"" dining locations where you mobile ordered and they brought food to your table was incredibly slow- usually about a 45-60 minute wait for food. There was no way to order cups of water on the mobile device, and when we asked for it when the waiter brought our food they seemed quite put out by the request. Maybe this wait is normal, but it was unexpected for us. It was so hard to find water in the park and you always felt like you were the biggest annoyance when asking for it. Many of the freestyle machines (I had been told you could get water from for free) did not offer free water.  --I stood in quite a few lines where the employees were much more interested in talking to one another than interacting with guests. In one line, they were talking about how hammered they had gotten at a party over the weekend. Another kept complaining about how hot and tired they were to another employee and couldn't wait to go on break. These were just a couple of examples. It was as if the park guests were invisible.  --We went knowing the mask rules, followed them to the best of our ability, and were thankful for the ability to not wear them outside when not in line. However, the rules did not make any sense in some instances. The most aggressive employees about masks were on the Red Fish, Blue Fish ride. They would literally interrupt the whole ride and song when a kid's mask fell off in flight below their nose or they moved it down when it got wet. These kids are outside, in the air moving, and at least 15 feet apart from each other. Literally, there is essentially no risk or reason to have masks on in that environment- why interrupt the ride to yell at them? It was just annoying.  One way they did GREAT in the park as we got shut down twice on rides and they did a great job of making it right. Men in Black broke down while we were on it. They kept us all calm and escorted us out with laughter and smiles and a one-time express pass. We waited in line for over an hour for Hagrids when it broke down. They gave everyone in line an exclusive express pass that included coming back to Hagrid's to cut the line which was a tremendous blessing. We also had breakdown problems at Minions and again on Hagrid's when we actually rode it (delay after the devil's snare for a brief bit that was a little terrifying as we could hear the next riders above us and were afraid they'd drop on us!).  The Universal App worked pretty well, but the wait times were rarely accurate for rides. Sometimes it was half as long as it was listed, sometimes twice as long. We went to go to Shrek and when we arrived at the line it said 25 minutes. Throughout our LONG line it continued to say that. Nearly an hour later, we finally got in. We went to Gringotts for a 20 minute line- and there was literally no wait- we climbed right in a vehicle! Mobile ordering was easy- but it doesn't save time. Paying on the universal app was sketchy and it wasn't accepted at the quick food service at CityWalk.  If Universal could improve its staffing both from a quality and quantity perspective, it would really benefit the guest experience.  We had purchased the Harry Potter package- in all, not worth the extra cost."
131,2016-1,I'm literally standing in a line for the Hagrid thing that I scheduled a slot on using the app. They've packed as many people in the line as they possibly can and are harping at us (threatening to kick us out of line for having our masks off our noses so that we can breath.
132,2016-1,"Universal Adventure Park was the best out of two we went to. Both were impressively clean, not to crowded & everyone enjoyed themselves. Wait times were a bit long but we expected that."
133,2016-1,"It’s no Disney, I’ll tell you that much. We just returned from a one day visit to Universal with park to park passes. We spent the two prior days at Disney and then switched hotels to Endless Summer Dockside. As a married couple, Dockside doesn’t offer king sized beds and has no sit down restaurants, but does have a cafeteria. It’s swarmed with teens and early 20s.  The early entry to Harry Potter is a racket. We got up early and waited in line for a bus, then arrived and waited shoulder to shoulder in the biggest crowd I’ve ever seen to get through security. Then we walked in and waited in another line to get access to the park. As the employee scanned my ticket, they dropped the rope and let in the masses. I asked what’s the point of arriving early if you get in at the same time as the masses and the employee told me we needed to arrive at 6am to get into the 8am early admission. Once we were in the park it was shoulder to shoulder for most of the experience (and this May 2021, still in the pandemic purportedly at limited capacity). The employees were worthless and rarely could answer questions. Went to the Leaky Caldron and asked the employee at the exit, “can I get a coffee here?”, she said no and sent me to the Hopping Pot. Waited in line and asked if Witches Brew was coffee (it’s beer), employee said go to the Leaky Caldron. Went back to the entrance of the Leaky Caldron, couldn’t get in because it was closed for a private event. Returned later as it appeared there was a short line, the employee says order your food on the mobile app while you wait. We do, and as soon as we get inside, the queue is hidden and waited an hour for food. We were upset and felt deceived that part of the queue is hidden and there’s no sign with the wait posted. It’s like they trick you into ordering to get you’re money and then you’re stuck waiting, hungry and thirsty. The food was “ok” and the staff seemed like zombies. Gringotts ride and queue was awesome. Don’t wait in line to buy a wand at Gregorovitches, or anywhere for that matter, it’s not an experience and you can literally buy the same wands everywhere, they sold them in our hotel giftshop. Get your butter beer early as the lines just get longer as the day passes. Line for Hogwarts express only gets longer to. Was 10min around 10:30-11:00. Was 45 min by noon. Diagon Alley is shaded and comfortable temp wise, but there’s no place to sit and rest, as is a complaint for all of Universal and IOA. Getting food and water was tough throughout the park, not enough quick carts with water and long lines. Hogs Meade is hot and sunny, no place to sit in shade and rest. We rode forbidden journey. Got right in with single rider. Then decided to leave for the day. Rather than wait for Howart’s, we walked through IOA. It’s sunny, no place to sit, no shade. And bad signage through US and IOA. Also, universal app is terrible compared to Disney. Tried to stop at several restaurants and get a bite to eat, hours long waits. Got to Citywalk and hours long waits. Also, bad signage. Many restaurants were closed and rather just put up a sign that no restaurants were open, we wasted energy walking. Finally gave up and left park. As we were leaving through a different park than we entered, stopped to ask security guard how to get back to hotel. He was rude unhelpful, acted like he had never heard of Endless Summer Dockside and then laughed and snarkily said, “well how’d you get here” as if I was a moron for asking. I had to explain, I’m leaving through a different park than I entered through, and just shrugged his shoulder and said, the same way you got here. FYI, the busses are the same for both parks. You walk through citywalk for both parks and then go back through security and down to where the buss dropped you. If you strictly want to ride coasters, universe might be for you. We found that the park is geared toward teens and early 20s, and is by and large and lower caliber of park goer and certainly the employees don’t even come close to the level of hospitality and helpfulness you get from Disney. We probably won’t go back unless there is a major expansion to Harry Potter. If anything, our experience made us appreciate Disney all the more."
134,2016-1,"We went to City Walk due to being with our quadriplegic son. Nothing but CHAOS in regards to parking. No STRUCTURE whatsoever. Unfortunately, we were in the lane furthest away from the handicap accessible area so we had to make our way all the way across to see if we could park in that area. We made it across -scary though- to try to ask the young lady if we could park in that area and she shoved us away, A guy not too - he did the same thing. Actually 4 people total. So we headed on with the rest of the crowd where we were sandwiched in. We parked and had to make it work to get him out. We went to Guest Services only for this guy to say ""we are working long hours"", told us he was working from 1 to 1 and maybe one of us could stand guard while he got out. He did go on to say he was making notes in the system, etc. I called maybe a day or so later to file a complaint as I was sure this guy didn't share our concerns and I was right. When I filed the complaint via phone, I was told my concerns would be shared with management as this was an ADA issue. He gave us a $15 gift card for whenever we returned. To date no one has reached out. All it would have taken was for one of thing to take a minute or so to see what we wanted. I was so disappointed as I have been to Universal many, many times and to have my son who was tragically hit by a CAR which is why he is quadriplegic, to have to park in this deck where his parents had to act as shields was ridiculous. Sad, sad, sad."
135,2016-1,For all ages rides and restaurants lots of photo opportunities and a fantastic water show the best I have ever seen.
136,2016-1,"The park is always awesome. It vets pretty crowded in the Harry Potter areas but all of the rides, shows, attractions are ""re-dunkously"" fun. My teens are 16, 17 and 19 and they cant get enough of this place."
137,2016-1,"It was humid, it was windy, we had to wear masks, but Universal still didn’t disappoint. Here’s a little breakdown on what to expect:  May 18- This was a Tuesday, and we chose to go midweek due to better ticket prices and (we hoped) less of a crowd. Even in a pandemic, there are still many people who want to get out to experience some thrills, so the parks were busy. The Universal Studios park was our focus for the day, and we got there as soon as it opened. I recommend this: go as soon as it opens and immediately ride the most popular rides. There will be a shorter wait time. Gringotts was our first ride, and we only waited about 10-15 minutes. After 10:30, the parks tend to get busier and lines much longer. You do have to wear masks the entire time you are in line (even if you are standing in line outside), but you can take off your masks while walking around the park. This was really nice given the humidity. By about 11, most wait times at the Universal Studios park are about 40-60 minutes on average. Depending on the time of day, restaurants will also have longer waits. We went to Mel’s Drive-In at 11:30 with only a short wait. There is one thing to be aware of: weather. Because of high winds, Rip Ride Rocket was “delayed”. Many people were surprised by this and gave workers a hard time, but keep in mind this is for your safety.  May 19- In our opinion, if you had to choose between the parks, choose Islands of Adventure. There are more thrill rides, and rides in general. We once again got to the parks as it opened and right away only had 10 minute waits for the Hulk ride, King Kong, and Harry Potter’s Forbidden Journey. Hulk and King Kong have about 60-80 minute waits on average. Lines started to get longer after 11:00. Here’s a tip: keep an eye on the Velocicoaster... it’s set to open on June 10, but there are random limited times the public can ride it. We rode it, and it was FANTASTIC if you love rollercoasters. Easily our favorite ride. Hagrid’s Motorbike Adventure is also a great experience. Again, don’t be surprised by long restaurant waits. Our longest wait time of the entire day was to enter the Three Broomsticks to eat for lunch (about 1:30 is when we got there). Worth the wait!  All-in-all, it’s still a great (and pricy) time despite the circumstances. If you need an escape, this is worth it!  (One more thing) Unless you are a huge Fast and Furious fan or have run out of rides, I would not wait longer than 30 minutes for Supercharged in the Universal Studios park. It’s underwhelming and very short."
138,2016-1,"very rude workers yelled at TONS of people. MULTIPLE rides broke down,very very dirty over all i would not recommend to anyone right now"
139,2016-1,"Went to is it Park on a Wednesday got there early. Had an early pass to get ahead of the crowds! lots of people long lines even during Covid could not imagine the place if it was at full capacity on a Saturday, still enjoyed the park."
140,2016-2,"So this was our first visit to Universal. We have been Disney Passholders for years but just never did Universal. That being said I guess I am used to Disney customer service and they are definitely NO Disney. Our trip was to be a two week trip with the first 7 nights spent at a Disney resort and then a 4 night stay at Universal. When I called to order tickets they told me they had a special package deal. I asked about the package but told them I wanted to stay on their property. She told me there was no availability on their property for our dates but she had a partner hotel right across the street from Universal that was available. She said they had suites with a kitchenette available for a little more so I opted for the suite. She assured me that this was a great hotel, close to the parks and that we would get all the same benefits of staying on property since it was a partner hotel and a package through them.  I looked at pictures of this hotel while on the phone with her at it looked very and clean and since Universal was selling it to me I booked it.  We had called the resort the morning we were to check in to see if we could get an early check in so we could get settled and head to City Walk for the day. We called five times and no one would answer the phone. First red flag! We got there to see if we could check in early and they said they had a suite available. The pictures I added are just a few of the disgusting room they stuck us in. When you opened the door the smell almost knocked you over. Not to mention the stains and cigarette burns all over the carpet. It was filthy, paint chipping off the walls, the furniture was peeling and chipped every where. There was a piece of cardboard with water stains covering the front of the dishwasher. It was so gross! My husband called the front desk to complain and she said she would move us to a newly renovated room. So we moved all our luggage to the “newly renovated” room only to go to a room that looked like it had not been cleaned since they renovated it. The carpets were filthy, there was a brownish stain on the grey couch that looked disgusting. The toilet paper holder was falling off the wall, we open up the sleeper sofa just to see it and it was a mattress with plastic over it, there were no extra linens in the room for the sofa bed, the bed in the room looked like someone had been on it already and we had paid extra specifically for the kitchenette ( full fridge, sink, dishwasher, little stove top and microwave). This room had a mini fridge and microwave ( I can get that at any standard hotel for much cheaper).  We decided there was no way we were going to stay there but since we paid Universal we figured they would need to fix this. We called and waited for 1 and half hours to talk to someone. She was kind but kept telling us there was nothing available on their property for our dates. I assured her at that point it didn’t need to be on their property; I just wanted a clean and decent room. She said a supervisor would have to help us but she would have to put us on hold until she could get one. Another half hour and finally a supervisor gets on. We explain the situation, how bad the hotel is and that we want a different place. After we paid them for this. He tells us it is not their fault that the hotel isn’t nice and kept asking us “what do you want me to do about it” He too was saying that they had no hotels available on their property. Again, I told him he needed to find us a different property, I don’t care where it is. He was so rude and uncaring of the situation they had put us in. I told him that we could have just stayed longer at our Disney resort and bought tickets for Universal but because there agent assured me this was a partner hotel close to the parks; I booked it. After about another half an hour on the phone with him he finally tells my husband the only way he can e en help us is if he goes down and the hotel lets us check out with a refund. So my husband agrees to do that and says “how do I call you back?” He says “I have no direct line so you can’t.” I said at one point that I found a bolted available at Disney and we would just go back there. The supervisor says “well that’s your choice” My husband said “I will keep you on the phone then while I go see if we can check out” He goes down checks out and another 15 to 20 minutes later they magically have rooms available at Endless Summer Dockside. It was after 5 by the time we got all the this settled and checked in to Dockside. Funny thing is that Dockside was a cheaper resort so we actually paid less. Also, I checked hotels.com that evening just to check and sure enough, I could have reserved a room through them for the length of our stay at Dockside. They stuck us in a terrible resort and then didn’t want to take responsibility or help us in any way. The attitude we got from the supervisor was awful. We did complain to guest services but it was City Walks guest services. He said he would send the information to Universal and we would hear from someone. It’s been a week since we checked out and we have still heard nothing. Never an apology! Clearly Universal’s guest services sucks!!"
141,2016-2,we went to universal on a class field trip and it sucked. we had 3 rides break down all in 1 day. never was able to ride the ripe rocket or whatever it’s called(the big red one) they said the wind was blowing to hard. we got stuck on the transformer ride and never got to re ride(they gave fast passes) we were in line for hulk and got almost to the top of the line and it broke down we stayed in like but waited like and hour and 30 minutes. the hotel was fun we stayed at cabana bay there was a lot to do if it wasn’t for the hotel fun the trip would have been rlly bad.
142,2016-2,"Universal studios... three theme parks 1 universal studios. A walk through the park with its many shops and. Few rides, NOT worth the price we paid. The food places are over priced, Nd very poor quality food, the City walk restaurants Re much better. In universal it cost me $9.90 for an ice cream only 2 scoops. There Re very few rides for children, a couple of adult rides. Not worth going. I paid over $730. For two people for three days at the three parks. Park 2 Adventure land? Much better, but still few kiddy rides and rides for people who dont want a roller coaster. If you like thrill rides then do this park. Food still garbage. Park 3 Volcano Bay. The best of all three. Take your own towel, unless you want to rent one for $6. Each. There Are things for older adults to do and children and thrill seekers, food is also much better and more reasonable priced. The Lazy river is the best , water 3 ft deep. Ride on an inner tube and have fun. If you are planning a trip to Universal Studios. I would recommend you skip the first park and stick to the other two. As for gift buying... dont buy anything inside the parks, go to one of the many. Bargain stores outside of the parks , you’ll get the same things as a quarter of the price. Try BENZER INTERNATIONAL INC 6454 International dr. T Shirts as low as $1.99 each I would not go back to Universal Studios. It was far to Expensive, and parking is $26 per day or $40 per day to park a little closer (. Not much closer) you still have a very long way to walk to get into the actual park... all in all Universal Studio is NOT worth it."
143,2016-2,Great price. Great experience. It was super easy to get the tickets via email voucher from TripAdvisor. Not much social distancing at the parks but they only allow families on rides together which is nice.
144,2016-2,"As Florida residents we've been to both universal parks many times over the years and one thing is for sure, each visit seems to have been worse than the previous one. Today, was no exception and the criticisms are plenty so let me begin: 1. Prices. Paying just shy of $800 in admission for one day for four people is plain obscene particularly when I consider what we got for that amount of money: In all, we were only able to ride SIX, got that right 6 rides despite relative low crowds. In the past we visited on days with crowds similar to today's and were able to ride almost all rides and repeat some with little waiting time but not today. Today, the parks seemed understaffed so we ended up with wait times befitting peak crowds in summer with some rides clicking a 70-minute wait. Again, and I can't stress this enough, today's attendance was light as evident by the empty parking lots. 2. Terrible organization. The ""geniuses"" running things decided to make even buying food an ordeal in itself. From 11am on we tried repeatedly to purchase drinks or food to no avail because even a simple line to buy butter beer at the harry potter side of things was a lengthy process. We were not able to drink or eat until 3pm and that, with minor children, is a big problem. One would think that in this post-pandemic times universal would have more venues open to avoid people conglomerating but no sir the ""geniuses"" think that having people line up in confined spaces for long wait times is just what we need to diminish the risks of corona virus transmission. I won't even get into the pricing for the drinks and food because that's another obscenity: $90 for four burgers and drinks is just absurd. 3. Rude staff. While most staff was cordial the fact is that the few bad apples make a more lasting impression and on that I can't avoid thinking of the two morons working at the security check point both of whom were rude, literally herding us with ""hurry up"" when we had been held back ourselves because of their own incompetence and then, there's the attendant at one of the harry potter rides who insisted in having me store my small bag (which I have used many times before at universal) while having no issue with women's purses that were significantly larger. I didn't oblige her smugness and simple placed my small bag under my shirt and not once was it an issue during the rides. So this sums up the nightmarish day our visit to universal studios and islands of adventure turned out to be. It's quite telling when children tell you that service was poor isn't it? That's what happened to us today. In the end we felt so disgusted by the whole thing that we didn't even bother staying overnight and drove back home to put some distance between us and this crappy nightmare the universal studios and islands of adventure have become. Would we recommend these two parks? Sure, if you're predisposed to being taken advantage and taken for granted."
145,2016-2,"This has been a long time coming. I've literally been coming to this park since I was a child. After growing up, moving to florida, even working here for a year and now being an annual pass holder I can say I love this park. It's not perfect and no park is but the technology they have added in there rides are amazing!!! Now I'm personally more of a fan of Islands of adventure myself but I always visit both parks while I'm there. Yes I prefer these parks over disney just because of the ease of everything while here. Plus they have actual thrill rides, unlike Disney. Regardless all the theme parks in Florida are great. You'll enjoy it- MrBucketlist"
146,2016-2,"I've been to Universal multiple times and have always been amazed at what they can do to make you really feel like you are in a world of magic. Harry Potter land is very impressive and fun for everyone. If you want to take your kids to the Wand Experience, go early or late so you don't run into crowds and have to wait a while and not get picked. Also, wear Harry Potter gear- they're more likely to pick you! The food is above average, but the butterbeer is a must get. All Simpsons fans MUST go to Springfield, USA. It is very well done, and the ride is hilarious. I would recommend Bumblebee man's tacos. Keep in mind that I went before the pandemic was really bad, so this might not be the current situation. Hope this helps!"
147,2016-2,"The Fast n Furious Supercharged ride was disappointing to say the least. The walk through the garage preparing for the ride was cool, but the actual attraction was poorly thought out as we expected the attraction to give us a ""fast n furious"" feel. Its been a whole week and I am still talking with my wife about how disappointing the ride was. Whether the ride is revamped into a roller coaster or a thrill ride, riders want to feel the speed. I envision a coaster with two tracks, sleek jet black cars for the riders, a few death-defying hills with nice drops, and a mean race to the finish line just like you see in the movie races. With all the advances made with thrill rides and simulators, I struggle to understand how this ride was put together to provide a fast n furious experience and completely missed the mark. Instead, the rider ends up constantly twisting their necks trying to keep up with a mad street race with guns and felt absolutely nothing during the ride except for a cramp in your neck from all the twisting and turning. The creators of this ride need to go back to the drawing board as this ride had the potential to elevate Universal to one of the top parks in Orlando. Instead, this ride hurt the prestige of the park. The creators need to do better as my family and I were thoroughly disappointed."
148,2016-2,Cannot fault universal studios absolutely loving every minute spent here much prefer it over the Disney parks so much more modern and advanced makes Disney seem dated all the rides keep you entertained while queuing and as person who hasn't watched all the Harry Potter films you don't need to it's just WOW amazing well done universal after marrying my wife and having my children best time of my life
149,2016-2,"Harry Potter world was especially awesome and Simpsons Springfield was cool too! All so detailed! ALOT of walking! If you have toun children, don't do it. Wait til they're older. I reuly didnt see any young kids that werent complaining LOL"
150,2016-2,"Many fun simulator rides and I love the ""Wizarding World,"" but overall customer service stinks. Specifically, couldn't get in early because only 1 gate was open, even though I stayed at a Universal resort solely so I could go in early. And paying twice to go in two connected parks is the biggest theme park rip-off ever!"
151,2016-2,"This was only about my third trip to Universal, and the first time I stayed at one of their resorts. It was pretty disappointing. The main reason I wanted to stay at one of their resorts was so that I could get into the park an hour early. I got up and got there a little before 8, which was when the early opening started. Instead, we stood there 45 minutes until the gates opened. It turns out, if they don't have enough employees, they only open one gate (there are 2 parks). And, unfortunately, I was standing at the wrong gate. I wouldn't have minded if I'd been told this ahead of time.  Other disappointments were Cauldron Cakes -- used to be sooo much better, had been looking forward to it all day -- is now basically a cupcake in a silicone cauldron (used to have ganache and an edible chocolate handle). The app was not that great, didn't really give directions to attractions. Also, there were a lot of rides where you were required to ""debag"" and put any backpacks, etc. in a locker. While the lockers were free -- probably the only free thing in the park -- this got to be a pain.  While the hotel was nice and new (Dockside), the light right when you came in the door didn't work and the walls were thin. I collapsed around 8 PM after a fun day in the park and was awakened by the people next door coming in around 11.  I definitely prefer Disney for overall experience and especially customer service. This may be my last Universal trip."
152,2016-2,"We spent a week at Universal Studios at the end of April. My husband and I and our 2 teenage sons had a wonderful time. We loved the rides in both parks and the Harry Potter worlds. Our only issue was lunch in The Three Broomsticks. We had purchased the quick service dining plan along with the freestyle souvenir cup. the third day we were told that our dining plan did not cover a drink with our meal since we had the freestyle cups. There are no sodas or freestyle stations to get drinks from in Harry Potter worlds. Drinks for 4 people would cost at least 16$ and I felt like I had already paid for this drink when paying for our dining plan. I asked to speak to manager but they would not come speak to me. Sent the kid to say we could have free glasses of water. Well, duh, you can get free water anywhere in the park. Any way, I let it go but it ruined our whole dining experience there. After we got home I looked over the information on the quick service and no where does it say that by getting the freestyle cup you would not get a regular, drink with your meal. It specifically states that a non alcoholic beverage comes with your dinner. I really only included ALL of this to let people know what to expect in the Harry Potter worlds. This was a major focus of our trip and to get so upset kinda ruined the day. Every other part of our trip was outstanding. Employees were always happy to help with any questions that we had about our first trip there."
153,2016-2,"Did the package resort and park deal. All the rides were really good. Masks are required over the mouth and nose, and they’re serious. Lots of hand sanitizer at every ride, and you must use it. I’d highly recommend the trip."
154,2016-2,"So far I have been on hold for over an hour to ask questions about tickets. They close according to eastern time so us pacific time folks have to call early. The park is only open until 7 pm? The price is more than ever and goes up based on the date you picked. If my kids didn’t make me, I wouldn’t visit this overpriced park. Way more expensive than Disney. Add $200 a person for express passes when the tickets are over $170?"
155,2016-2,"Just returned from weekend at Universal. Stayed at Portofino, which is always wonderful. I have had annual pass for past 6 years. I agree with other reviews: STAY HOME. The parks are painful in the heat with masks, and it is not even summer sizzling yet here in Florida. Mask police with bullhorns are roaming to yell that you cannot walk and drink. Usually, one of the bars is a great refuge for adult visitors. No, denied! You need reservations to sit at a bar. Then, good luck getting through the reservation line. Toothsome Chocolate Factory especially annoying where I always visit on trips. Friend and I booted off barstools since didn’t have a reservation. So disappointed in this trip to Universal. Our state is doing great with COVID containment; however, you would never know it in Orlando!"
156,2016-2,"I have a special needs child who just turned 3. He really wanted to go to Universal so we flew all the way out to Florida. When we were checking in at the front gate, the park rep started berating my 3 year old for not wearing a mask. I explained that he had sensory issues with his face and had a doctors note showing he could not wear a mask due to his medical condition. The park rep said, ""That's your problem not mine."" and kicked us out telling us we needed to go to park services. We had to wait in another 1 hour line just to get a wrist band identifying my child as special needs. This is not the way to treat people. I could tell this park rep had never had children the way he was treating us with such disrespect. I understand some people are in such fear of the pandemic but there are special needs children who have sensory issues with their face. We flew out to Florida since the governor lifted the mask mandate and figured we could have a good outdoor experience. Also, we went to Lego Land before this and had absolutely no issues. Lego land allowed kids under 8 to not wear masks. It will be hard for me to give Universal another try since the workers there have no respect for children."
157,2016-2,"We were disappointed because as a family of 12, 4 were under the age of 11 and unable to ride most things. We paid $145/ticket for each person, the kids area was closed down, there was a pretty severe storm that rolled through (no fault of the park obviously) and that shut down several things also. You have to buy multi day hopper pass because you can't purchase a single day, multi park ticket and thats $292 for 2 adults! Apparently we didn't research enough to know that the majority of the rides we were looking forward to, were in the Island of Adventure park, and we couldn't access them. We walked the entire park in a fairly short amount of time and half our group went back to the hotel because there was nothing for the little people to do after about 2.5 hours. The other half stayed longer to ride a few things and even at half capacity, we still had to wait 60 minutes for the Harry Potter ride which was cool, but short and not worth the wait. I couldn't imagine waiting hours for it! As typical, food was crazy expensive and just ehhh, ok, parking $26.... There was no sanitization available at the drink refill stations and everyone just kept touching the same surfaces and I never saw anyone wiping them down. We were so excited for this visit and were incredibly disappointed in our first experience."
158,2016-2,"On day one we were seriously aware that no one was enforcing the cleaning, masking or distancing restrictions. The staff at the stores in CityWalk were rude and not accommodating. The parks were ok during the week but its dirty with long chaotic lines. The only reason to go is to see Harry Potter in my opinion. My suggestion is go during the week and go early otherwise you will be packed in with hundreds of others in the heat without proper restrictions. We stayed in the last day to watch the reality tv show that was occurring hourly between patrons and staff by the pool at the hotel. Save your money and go to Disney."
159,2016-2,"Our family did both parks in two days during COVID, with a park hopper. We intentionally chose this time to go in the hopes of lower crowds due to reduced capacity limits. We also picked the first week of May for the same reason - hoping for slightly lower crowds.  It was our first time to Universal theme parks, and we had a great time. My kids are probably unusually adventurous and hardy (as a friend of our says, they are like little Vikings), so at 11 and 6 they both had a blast here, and found it a little more exciting than Disney (“less boring” as my 6 year old said). We did opt for the unlimited Express-pass, and we were not sure it was worth it. This could be due to the reduced capacity. Which I will say I can’t imagine these parks with 50% more people in them. I would never come here during peak season, as the parks themselves are more compact than Disney. We had the ability to child-swap with the family we came with, so all of us were able to ride most of the rides twice. So by the second day, we didn’t really want to ride anything again, which made the unlimited pass seem unnecessary. I wouldn’t come here without at least the one time express pass though, because in two days we did everything! Overall, we found the food situation a bit difficult to navigate, but I feel like once you get to know it, it made more sense. It was hard to just find food when you were hungry without excessive waits. The mobile ordering was not really intuitive, and we couldn’t get my account working to try it anyway.  Here’s what we loved about US. Diagon Ally is amazing, and we spent quite a bit of time here. There are more 3D-4D rides on this side, and we really enjoyed them, although not everyone in our party was as interested. My daughters loved the Simpsons ride and it’s pretty funny. In fact one of the things we enjoyed about Universal, was a lot of laughs, wit, humor and the sense of immersion in the movie.  Drawbacks were few, the main one being the Wand Experience, which is a hyped up sales pitch. A tip is get there during early admission if you can the first day and sign up it, then purchase the wand. After the experience we didn’t have the heart to say no to them, and ended up buying two more wands. The other disappointing thing was they only chose our oldest daughter for the show. Luckily I asked about it as they ushered us out (as I didn’t that understand going into it), and they nicely called us back in. They did a truncated version of the show for my little one, but she rolled with it. My youngest always seems to get the short end of the stick, so I was initially mortified by this, as she just wilted as we were walking out. My tip would be to let the wand master know that both kids need a wand (they did both the kids for the family we were traveling with) or ask about booking different times."
160,2016-2,"First off most of the information given to me by Guest Services over the phone was inaccurate. The dining plan is only good within the parks according to a staff member at our resort and the refillable cups are only good in the parks as well. The freestyle cup has to be activated daily which is a major inconvenience since you have to wait in long lines just to activate a cup then go look for a station to fill it at. A staff member at our resort actually told us even though 1 of the restaurants within the resort is listed as quick service facility they don't accept the dining card and when I mentioned it to a staff member at the park she seemed surprised and said ""I guess I learned something today."" The 2 park per day ticket is only good for the theme parks which I had been told it applied to all 3 parks. If you want to go to Volcano Bay you have to purchase the 3 park ticket. The photo package was a total waste of money. Only a few rides take pics and I only saw 1 person in front of the theme park taking pics which I never got since she told me she couldn't scan my photo pass she had to give me a different card each time and I wasn't able to download them. Maybe we are a little spoiled by Disney since everything is extremely convenient with them. Everything with Universal is unorganized and wastes a ton of time. If they made everything accessible through the app it would be so much easier. The only thing good about Universal is they keep the ride lines moving and the wait is not that long at all but summertime may be different."
161,2016-3,"We were a group of 3 older women with canes that love Harry Potter. The attendants on the rides were great, but some other workers - such as the wicked wizards at Olivetti's wands were just plain rude. They refused to answer questions just said 'we had to have a tablet' and to 'go away' . We found a more personable wizard the next day and he explained that we had to be there very early (and we had early admission and got there asap) and did not give us much hope. We did not want to come back at 5 in hopes of a cancellation. High heat , masks, old women and wicked wizards just do not work. We stayed in park just in the mornings and did not come back the 3rd day. Stay away"
162,2016-3,"My husband and I visited Universal a couple years ago and had a fantastic time. This trip didn’t meet those expectations. The rides IF/WHEN you got to them met our expectations. Several were closed for most of the day. Temps hit 95 all days we were there. You were forced to wear a mask all the time except when you were “actively eating or drinking in a stationary spot.” The Express Passes ruined our visit. I get it the Express People paid extra, but there needs to be limits to give the Gen Pop a fair chance at the rides. A 25 min wait at the train turned into a 70 min wait in the hot dungeon with our faces covered. People were dropping from the heat.  Places to eat and drink experiences long, slow, never-ending lines of people waiting in the sun. Since our last visit, Universal has added two huge hotels and two new, modern rollercoasters, but no new places to get food and drink. The park has limited infrastructure and the visitors needs need to be addressed too.  We stayed at Endless Summer hotel which was very nice, but the lobby stayed warm due to all the people. (It was only 1/2 full too.) Pier 8 offered some reasonably priced food items. Some items we wish we could have used, but we had no microwave in our room. :.( Staff members were friendly and courteous. We also had to buy coffee in the park since we don’t drink Starbucks and we also didn’t have a coffee maker in our room.  We chose this time because school was still in session. Ha! Can you say “virtual learning!” We cut our vacation short by a day. Between the heat, masks, and crowds, we’d had enough."
163,2016-3,"I’m in Universal Studios right now standing in an outside line. It’s 90 degrees here. The wait is 70 minutes long and they just broadcasted an announcement that “for everyone’s safety no eating or drinking is permitted while in line. Please keep your face covering over your mouth and nose at all times.” Meanwhile we are standing in the sun, dripping in sweat, and the lines are “socially distanced”."
164,2016-3,"we had the dining pass but the wait times were ridiculous. The park itself was great, The lines were not awful until after 2pm"
165,2016-3,"✅ $850💵 + ⏰ hours of high heat 91 degrees🔥 & 😷☀️. We were shocked to be in long lines walking about 7.5 miles for the day masked up! Like sheep 🐑 being threatened constantly with loud speaker 🔈announcements demanding no drinking 🥤or eating while walking 🚶‍♀️& maintain social distancing, wearing a mask at all times or being 👢booted from the park. I saw kids 👆touching all handrails and then putting hands in their parents cups eating ice and then the parents gulping down the remainder(at $10 per beverage can you blame them) 🤷‍♂️ confused I do thousands of people show up to spend 💰💰💰💰💰💰if they are paranoid of public places! Universal Studios is a germs 🦠 paradise! They also pray on people’s wallets with the nifty reservation system it allows them to supply and demand fast passes from $80 extra to $249 demanding on all the variables they control! We despised being ordered around with lousy customer service! Constant loud interruptions🛑 during the rides 🎢demanding guests wear a mask 😷! Save yourself the 💰money, headaches 💊 and don’t go!! It’s ridiculous hypocrisy! Stay home save yourself the money and respiratory distress wearing a mask in 91 degree weather! Big brother is 👀watching!"
166,2016-3,"I've been waiting multiple DAYS on the phone to modify my vacation package (I do have the paid Cancellation option, but we did not even get that far...).  And of course any change cannot be done online. I can only advise people to stay far from the vacation packages! Find a tour operator or buy tickets separately. Or do so if you are sure you don't need to change anything. I guess in covid times nobody can say that though. You would have to go anyway and spread the virus, or loose thousands of $... For sure they won't allow to reimburse a-posteriori as it's a 7 days prior limit in the conditions.  Not even sure I want to go anymore now..."
167,2016-3,"We totally loved our experience at Universal mid April, with two kids 10 and 6. I have a few important tips: -100% buy the express pass, it's totally worth it. Without it, no way to enjoy all the rides even during a weekday; -bring snacks/food and water bottles. We had a stroller even if my daughter is way too old to use it on a daily basis, but it was awesome to be able to carry stuff all over the park. We didn't have to wait in line for food as we packed sandwiches and snacks; - skip the shops and buy souvenirs outside the park if you want to save money and wait lines; - skip the VIP parking; -wr hated the Virtual line system for the Hagrid ride. We couldn't get on despite trying for two days. They should just allow standby lines in addition to virtual lines to avoid so many frustrated people clicking insanely on their phones; -skip the Pterodactyl ride if the line is more than 20 minutes. It's so short it's not worth it; -must do for us: HP escape from Gringotts, HP journey, Transformers 3D, The Mummy, Jurassic river adventure, Hulk rollercoaster, Tycoon Lagoon... All in all, it was amazing and I would definitely do it again!"
168,2016-3,"This was our 3rd and by far worst experience at Universal. We had a park to park pass and only rode a total of 6 rides due to long wait times and shortened hours . We stayed on Universal Property which was wonderful with the exception of over priced food options. Anyway, even with early park entry it was very disappointing. We did look into fast passes and found out they were far too expensive (@$240 per person) which is way out of budget after paying the park to park admission. Lines were long the park was over crowded and people were not observing social distancing. We tried getting reservations same day at the restaurants on city walk and they were booked 3 days out ."
169,2016-3,We enjoyed the rides and attractions! The food was good! Many friends go here! The employees are rude! Never changed! Casey said she worked here! Thank you!
170,2016-3,"I don't understand the hype at all. Harry Potter Diagon Alley was the only good thing about this place but even at that it was incredibly overcrowded and we couldn't even experience any rides or shows. And the Dragon on Grigott's was not able to breathe the fire! The people working there said they didn't know why it wasn't working. Everything else in the park is outdated and irrelevant. Long lines, too crowded, not much to do, overpriced. Just a lot of stores to buy overpriced commercialized products. the one rollercoaster my daughter wanted to go on got closed down after she waited over an hour in line. And at some point during the day my other daughter's HP wand was stolen out of our bag that we had been carrying all day. It was never one placed down. We will NEVER return to this trap."
171,2016-3,Absolutely complete waste of money! Have a disabled child and the whole family got attitude and we were treated like garbage. Waited in hour in line because 2 people were working the line for a disability pass. Got the pass after several weird questions on her disability. The pass is useless once you pick a ride you wait for your time to return. In the meantime you can not go on another ride. So what do you do for an hour with a disabled child. Disney has no issues with there system. The food service is even worse recieved 2 burgers with hair in it. Didn't get our drinks till 20mins after we received the food. We and several other families were told with an attitude that they are behind on drinks! You expect me to believe it's harder to pour soda then make a burger. For 400$ we got to go on 2rides. Complete waste of 8hrs and 400 hundred dollars. STICK WITH DISNEY!!!
172,2016-3,"I really needed to leave a review, we haven't been yet but planning is part of all the work. I did have trouble with the website and trying to get anyone on the phone at guest services. But we finally booked our trip on the website and decided a few days later to add a few things . When I called this time there was only a five minute wait. I had the pleasure of speaking to Sharon, she was not only helpful but she gave me tips, advice and was so pleasant. Sharon was so personable and a breath of fresh air. She helped me so much and I am so looking forward to this trip. I really wanted to do the survey after we spoke but we were disconnected. So here's my survey, Thank you Sharon."
173,2016-3,"TLDR; They don’t observe or enforce Covid safety precautions and the limited park hours and long wait times make the trip a waste of time and money.  We went on April 26th and as soon as we walked up to the entrance, it was chaos. I wish I had taken a photo because I hadn’t seen a crowd like this since before Covid. I was shoulder to shoulder with unmasked strangers and did not see a single Universal employee in sight until we were at the main entrance to City Walk getting our temperature checked. At that point, the poor women checking temperatures were screaming at people to form a line. Everything in me was telling me to turn around and just ask for a refund, but I hoped it would get better once we got into the park.  Trying to get into the park wasn’t any easier, there were no guides to show us where to go and things were extremely backed up.  Once in the park, we figured we’d wait until wait times for Harry Potter rides went down and decided to ride some of the rides closer to the front of the park. The first line we get into was stress-inducing and made me want to leave right away. We begged people to observe the markings on the ground and keep a safe distance from us, but it wasn’t happening. People were taking their masks off in line when Universal employees were out of site (which I rarely even saw employees anyway) and even eating in line. We were unable to distance from the people in the lines to the left and right of where we stood and much preferred Disney’s plexiglass shields in these situations to Universals lack of dividers. It was loud (even for a musician that is hard of hearing) and the people in line with us were obnoxious and rude.  The whole reason we came to Universal was for Wizarding World of Harry Potter, but wait times were always over 75 minutes (or higher) and the Harry Potter parts of the park were always over crowded that we decided to keep our distance. It’s obvious they weren’t limited capacity. Everywhere we went, we were dodging people and trying to distance ourselves from others with no luck or reciprocated efforts.  After riding ONE Harry Potter ride (and not even the one we wanted to ride), we ended our day early and literally ran to the car to get out as fast as we could. Our experience was not worth the money for the ticket or the stress we endured throughout the park.  Honestly, we were shocked. Our experiences at the Disney parks were incredible as the staff went above and beyond to make sure Covid safety precautions were being followed and enforced. We never felt uncomfortable and rode every ride we wanted in every park with wait times under 45 minutes."
174,2016-3,"This ride sucked. Completely lame. Over in about 2 mins. I get it, we were on a bus, not much you can do with it but the Kong ride is similar and 100% better. Do not waste your time even with a fast pass. And Vin Diesel is a horrible actor. :)"
175,2016-3,"Just got back from 3 days at Universal. Despite the mask mandate, everyone seemed to be having fun and glad to be out !!! Park is always clean but they are going above and beyond. New Hagrid's ride was the bomb !!!!"
176,2016-3,"We are scheduled to leave on June 14. If I had not promised two kids who have autism this trip, would cancel! We have visited several times but customer service is just AWFUL this time!!! The hold time is over 2 hours and the website is consistently down. I am needing to make a change in dining plan, pay full balance, and ask about the shuttle when we arrive. Why is this so hard. It will be a VERY long time before I visit this place again. I have a ton of other things to do with 8,000.00. Maybe we'll try Disney?"
177,2016-3,Both parks did such a great job even with covid going on. I was very impressed. Harry Potter world is such an amazing feature.
178,2016-3,"I would highly recommend NOT visiting during Covid. Our experience this morning was horrific. There weren’t any staff anywhere guiding people as they parked, no clear line markers or barricades for lines, masses of people with no social distancing, only 3 people taking temperatures, nothing was contactless w with sec urity or check in, no notable capacity limit. After spending 3 days at Disney where everything was seamless & easy to navigate, this is a nightmare. And all the Harry Potter stuff is closed this morning."
179,2016-3,"Enjoyed all rides that I went on.  Tip: bring ear plugs for noisy rides, noisy queues and noisy walk ways around the park  Tip: Bring rain gear or cheap ponchos.  Went during the Mardi Gras extended celebration and got the 15 taster pass and enjoyed all the different food. Portions are samplers size so not sure the ala carte pricing is worth it but the pass makes it affordable.  I do not recommend the Jurassic park cafe that sever the smoked turkey legs, etc.  Also a bummer to never get a virtual line confirmation for hagrid's ride. Think our last day the line was open to everyone but virtual line seems to be a joke  If Universal is reading this, have more than 1 person at the photo stations to help find the riders for popular rides and/or invest in better technology to find the riders."
180,2016-3,Too many people were let into the park the day I visited Wednesday April 21st. I didn’t think a Wednesday in the middle of April would be packed but Universal offers special passes to Florida residents which makes the situation worse. The park was miserable because of the long wait times. Too many gift shops and restaurants and not enough rides. Three of the rides had to stop at different times because of technical difficulties and a 4th ride had to completely shut down after we wait in line for 30 minutes. This is the worse theme park I have ever been to. We paid around $170 per ticket to visit both small parks which should be one big one. Then we couldn’t really ride more than a couple of popular rides all day long because of excruciating wait times. I was going to buy an express pass for $67 the quote online from Universal’s website but the lady said because of the number of people in the park they would be $240. Omfg so a family of four costs around 700 to visit and express passes for just one park would be $960. It would be $1660 for a family of four just to have an enjoyable experience at the park not including the outrageous food or parking costs. Save yourself and read my review...maybe you won’t make my mistake.
181,2016-3,I enjoy universal for what it is..it’s definitely not Disney. Harry Potter is by far the shining gem of the park. I have three suggestions- 1. Fix the Hogwarts ride. It needs to be a bit smoother. It tilts you on your back for too long creating nausea due to stomach acid rising. The screen itself seems a bit burly. It should be the best ride due to it being in hogwarts instead it’s the worst ride in all of universal but the queue is incredible. They should really look to the flight of passage for inspiration here... 2. Let adults ride on the Pterodactyl hang glider ride even if they don’t have kids. There isn’t one ride at Disney that adults can’t ride...you charge the same amount for tickets...step up 3. I think it would be really cool if there is room for this at hogwarts- a sit down nicer meal in the dining hall. When you get a reservation you could get digitally “sorted” into a house and you would sit in that section in the dining hall. Or perhaps universal could build a hogwarts hotel like Disney is doing with Star Wars and that could be a part of the experience.  Overall I enjoy universal. I do enjoy Disney more but universal has Harry Potter so...I visit them both.  I would love to see universal expand their parks and even creat a more immersive experience in other areas of the park as they have done so well with Harry Potter.  I will that that whoever designed Hagrids motorbike ride... amazing job. It’s truly the BEST ride I ever have rode in any park. The way I describe it to people is ... it’s more intense than a Disney rollercoaster but not so intense that you don’t have fun. It’s perfect. That ride is truly the most perfect formula for a rollercoaster!  Excited about the future!
182,2016-4,"Wait in long lines everywhere. Ok so there is a lot of hurdles at the parks and it takes you more than 1 hour to just get in the door. They have added a metal detector and they take temperatures as well. (Maybe use temperature screening camera's to speed things up?) In addition, their software at the park to allow people to enter the park is less than satisfactory. You must give them your fingerprint, and it takes 30 seconds per person to just scan a ticket and get in the doors. (another long and slow moving line) To pick up tickets at Will Call 50% of machines did not work (another line).  Notes for their mgt...fix the terrible IT infrastructure, and you don't need my fingerprint!"
183,2016-4,We had a very good time while visiting Universal Studios! The only drawback is long lines any time of the day... lots of people even on weekdays. Express pass costs $200 per person which would put $800 dent in our budget for 4 people just for a day... that was unreasonable. So we just stood in line... Harry Potter town and a ride was the most interesting in my opinion. Universal did an amazing job with Harry Potter section! Very worth visiting! We highly recommend it.
184,2016-4,"Our flight to Universal Studios in Orlando was cancelled due to a snowstorm six weeks ago. Despite purchasing Universal's cancellation insurance, we still have not received a refund."
185,2016-4,"Absolutely phenomenal! I’m beyond impressed! We went on one of the busiest weeks of the year. Chose not to purchase any of the perks except upgraded parking each time. We would go early morning ride what we could before the heat. Grab lunch in City Walk and come back refreshed in the evening. We did that three times! And it was fantastic. Stayed at our time share about 20 minutes away. Employees were incredible! Hand sanitizer everywhere and on every ride! Park was so clean! And they had a great night show! I cannot wait to bring our family back and experience everything again! Kids 18, 15 and 8! Two grown adults that also acted liked kids (mom and dad)! Best trip Ever!"
186,2016-4,"1. Website showed limited capacity yet people were on top of each other in both parks. So crowded. Forget social distancing. 2. Many people were not wearing masks properly or at all, yet staff walking by didn't say anything. One woman became verbally aggressive when she heard my comment about everyone needing to wear masks. 3. It's so expensive for a family to visit Universal. Having to pay for 2 parks just because park has 2 sections. Disney parks added on but don't charge separate admission. 4. We started with 2 express passes for oldest kid and my husband, but quickly realized we'd be waiting 1.5 hours each ride so bought 3 more express passes. Yet still had to wait almost an hour at many rides with express passes! 5. Food places were insanely crowded and expensive. $15 for a turkey leg that was dried out and awful. Cupcake was hard and stale. 6. We bought tickets online yet no info that hagrid's ride sells out early. I knew we couldn't use fast pass, but had no idea we couldn't wait in line for the ride as it sold out after noon. 7. No signs, no maps. 8. We paid for preferred parking, yet they made us walk back to general parking lines to go thru security. 9. I will never go back to Universal Studios in FL again. This is my 3rd trip to it, but this time was insanely expensive - almost $3000 just for park tickets and express passes. I could've gone on another trip to Disney! Disney is doing it well with keeping people masked up and socially distant and still having fun time! Universal Studios is so overrated!"
187,2016-4,"We spent 3 days at Universal Studios to begin our spring break. Our expectations were uncertain due to the vastly different reviews but we took the negative ones with a grain of salt and we are so glad that we did. Yes, there is a slew of people in the park. Yes, they have varying degrees of adherence to the rules. BUT the staff works so hard to strike the balance of regularly reminding guests of the safety measures and allowing guests to immerse themselves in the experience. Even during this busy time of year, lines were not too terrible and while intially lines for food were quite long we stumbled into online ordering which was not even a fraction of the regular wait time. For that reason alone....download the app! We were able to get on all the rides with exception of Haggrids which was a digital line and never opened up for us on the app. We also could no secure any reservations in the restaurants, so learn from our fail and try to book those in advance. I was very intimidated about the wait in line to wait in line concept (aka the screening before entry), that was worthless worries....the process was very smooth and moved much quicker than I could've ever anticipated. That all said, it is what you make it.....my 17 and 10 year old years had such a wonderful time and despite the COVID circumstances we all find ourselves in, we still found the magic in the park. The staff was friendly and we had a great time! So happy that the park was open, we were able to get tickets and our family had the experience before my oldest graduates and moves onto other life adventures."
188,2016-4,"My family and I went to Universal Studios during our Spring Break. We purchased a 3 day 3 park ticket, and it made our trip very enjoyable. The Universal App helped us navigate which rides had the shortest waits, so we parked hop based on these times. Being able to use the 3 days within a 6 day time frame made our trip more restful. There were 2 days we walked over 20,000 steps. This was our first theme park visit since my 11 year old was diagnosed with Type I diabetes. He has to travel with a bag of medicine and supplies. All the ride attendees were very accommodating to us and helped us store his supplies prior to getting on the rides. I can’t thank y’all enough! We were very impressed and appreciate your help. My favorite ride was the Harry Potter train. I’ve read all of the books, and it was surreal to experience this ride. They did an incredible job making the books come to life. This area is extremely crowded. I would like to go back at a less busy time and have time to more time to enjoy."
189,2016-4,"I would not got there if it was free, no service, long lines, price gouging on express pass, mask nazis, no bar service. Do not waste you money!"
190,2016-4,"You can’t imagine how disappointed I was with Universal Studios in Orlando. One hour on hold to buy tickets before I got to the park ( and they suggested I hang up and call AAA). The drone of “keep your masks on or we will remove you from the premises”. Some rides were jam packed while others loaded to 1/3 full. Surly and unhelpful staff ( when you can find them.) Few tables or benches that aren’t in direct Florida sun. No maps aside from one stand at the main entrance and almost no signs. I had my heart set on the Hagred ride and couldn’t get a place in the virtual line all day. Every ride ends at a gift shop. They wouldn’t let me buy a meal in Jurassic park without giving my email and phone and I was deluged with spam by days’ end. Just badly done. I’ll never, never be back  By the way, the butter beer is just cream soda"
191,2016-4,"For the price we paid I expected a better experience. The rides could be more accommodating to larger individuals. Very limited options for clothing sizes for plus size women. Too much walking - no shuttle from he parking lot and the food options were too expensive. The one thing that made the visit worthwhile was the Bourne Stuntacular. Best show ever! But again, seating could be wider for the larger individual."
192,2016-4,"First the way they do their entry lines is ridiculous. See Disney and Sea World on how to do it right. They have those airport bins and metal detectors but if you watch, they don't clean the bins at all. They just move them back to the front. Okay in normal times but if you require face masks and social distancing then clean your stuff! They don't do reservations so if you get there and its at capacity you get turned away. That is a stupid policy and bad customer service. They have bad food and bad service. Avoid avoid avoid"
193,2016-4,I was quite disappointed that it was suppose to be open at a certain capacity but it was so overcrowded that you had to wait 1hour and 20 minutes for most rides We couldnt get near any of the harry potter rides we went on 4 rides total from both places and left disappointed
194,2016-4,"I'm an amusement park fan. This was the worst experience of my life! 4 Major Points: 1) Locked out 2) Wait Times 3) Customer Service 4) Ride Shut Downs 5) Locker Fees  1) Locked out of Volcano Bay even though we arrived at 8:00 AM! Universal Oversold their parks. We bought a 3 Day - Park to Park pass. We were told by Guest Services that if we got inside Universal Studios or Islands of Adventure, we would be counted in the capacity count for Volcano Bay. My family went to U.Studios at 8:00 AM. We road a couple of rides then walked to the shuttle bus to go to Volcano Bay at 9:30 AM. The Bus Police asked to see our tickets. We were not allowed on the bus because Volcano Bay was at capacity the moment it opened at 10:00 AM!!! Universal states if you are in any one of their parks, you will be included in the capacity numbers. The Bus Police said they would ONLY ALLOW Single Day Volcano Bay Ticket holders on the bus. Universal never explains that Single Day Ticket Holders have preferential treatment or status vs Multi-Day Park To Park Hopper. We paid extra for Park to Park Hopping. I went to guest services and they told me the same thing. ""Sorry, Single Day Ticket holders are guaranteed admission and my 3 day Park to Park doesn't guarantee me admission."" We spent $2,700 and could never get to the water park. Universal suggests getting to the park early as the park may reach capacity. Volcano Bay reached capacity right at 10:00 AM when it opened. There were people waiting at the gate who were turned away at 10:00 AM. You can't get to the park any earlier if it reaches capacity before it opens people.  2) Wait Times - Ridiculous even with Virtual Line Pass. Our family had the App open and could only snag 1 time for Hagrid's. The line was so long, we waited 110 minutes! That's almost 2 hours long even with Virtual Line Pass! No 2 Min 50-second ride is worth almost 2 hours waiting in line! We averaged 7 rides each day. Totally not worth it! So many lines that were 45-90 minutes wait times.  3) After several families almost revolted over the Volcano Bay debacle, one of the guest services individuals gave me the Guest Services contact phone number (407) - 224-4233 to voice my complaint. This Guest Services number doesn't allow you to talk with a real person about any complaints!!!  4) Ride Shut Downs and inaccurate wait time postings. A) Waited 40 minutes for MIB and it shut down. B) Waited 30 minutes for Rip Rocket and it shut down C) Waited 15 minutes for Minions but left line because of delay  5) All the $2.00 locker fees add up!!! Beware!  Never Going Back! I can go to Cedar Point, Six-Flags, and King's Island to obtain greater value for the money spent at Universal."
195,2016-4,I think JK Rowling saved Universal. My daughter who is a huge Potter fan wanted to go for the HP worlds and that is all we did. The rest of the parks we both had no interested in waiting in long lines for 3-D rides. If you only go to one park though and don't care too much about rides Universal's Diagon Alley has more to offer than Hogsmead. The gringots ride though is a lot scarier than we thought it would be though. I guess we should have figured with all the warning about not to ride if you have high blood pressure! The park was crowded though everyone was wearing masks. We didn't get yelled at if we were having a sip of water or taking a break sitting down without our masks on like I have heard in some reviews. They have learned from Disney in that the staff are like cast members and anything they talk about it's like they are really in Hogwarts.
196,2016-4,"Let me begin by saying my wife and I love US. But, the whole idea of virtual lines, and only opening certain times throughout the day, is a major problem.  US has implemented a procedure of designating times (11:00, 2:00, 4:00) when a virtual line will open up for certain rides, including the major attractions like Hagrids... The problem is that at the stroke of the hour, the lines are already full. We attempted, for four days, to get a place in a virtual line to ride this ride. After spending thousands of dollars on a vacation, researching, reading, and watching several videos on the new ride, we were excited to finally experience this world class ride, but to no avail.  When we were watching our phones changes to the hour, we were forced to continually ""refresh"" our request to secure a spot in the virtual line. Literally, we were hitting refresh as fast as we could, yet, we were not able to get a spot. When the screen changed a couple of times for us to select a time slot, we thought we made it in only to find out when we submitted our time that those times were already full. Just an insane system.  I understand if this was done to avoid standing in lines due to Covid, which is why I gave it two out of five stars. But if this is the new way of standing in lines, only the quick fingers will ever make it on a world class ride, especially in a park that is as popular as US."
197,2016-4,"This is a review of customer service. Holy heck, i have NEVER had a more terrible customer service experience, especially compared to disney. I tried to change my reservation online but was told i need to call. I waited 2.5 hours on hold to change the date of my hotel stay. I had purchased a 4 day promotion and bought the cancel at any time add on. I was told it wads 50$ to make any modification to any reservation with Universal. Disney would NEVER. at disney you can easily change reservation add and link tickets all online, The customer service is GARBAGE for universal."
198,2016-4,"The whole trip was fantastic! My kids enjoyed it, my husband enjoyed it, I even enjoyed it which is surprising as I don’t like rides! The only thing that somewhat rained on our parade was it was raining, of course the park staff can’t control that! That and my husband saying he wanted a divorce were the lows of the trip but the rest was filled with highs. LOL! Like my little one saved up and loved all his little souvenirs, and his older brother liked all the rides! I would visit again maybe in a few years when COVID goes away. Lots of love from Linda!"
199,2016-4,"We took an Uber from the hotel, and that was easygoing since we were dropped off at a parking garage. No walking in the heat until we got to the main entrance where our personal belongings were scanned through a security check point. No temperature checks!!!! We visited on a Friday.  We had mobile etickets. It was easy to show and go. No need to wait in line when we first arrived at 3 pm. Pleasant weather with a nice breeze in April.  There are 2 important things you must know prior to purchasing tickets:  1) The former Harry Potter rides (Hogwarts Castle and the Hippogriff) are located at The Islands of Adventure. Thankfully, we've been there twice since Harry Potter was introduced to Orlando. The latest and greatest ride in Diagon Alley is the Gringotts Bank Vault Ride. Both Diagon Alley and Gringotts Bank ride are situated at Universal Studios. If you want to ride the Hogmead Train at Kings Crossing, you will need to purchase tickets to both The Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios. It's a 4 minute train ride! Please keep that in mind.  2) Unless you have an Express Pass, you must expect long wait times. All the rides will not have all the seats filled. For example, if the seat row has 4 seats total staff will only allow 2 people per row. If you have an even number of people in your party, you can have a partner sitting next to you. If you have a odd number, there's going to be a member going solo. Some lines entering rides will have a 6 foot distancing between families/parties while others do not. I'm not sure why this happened. Gringotts are people packed like sardines inside the bank while Shrek had people incredibly spaced out in line.  What I was disappointed with is that there were not alot of benches and seats! However, there were alot of tables set up everywhere the eye could see. Most of them were ""bar/pub"" style tables where you stand up and eat. It's not my favorite way to enjoy delicious but expensive food but pleased that the tall tables were spaced 6 feet apart.  Also, i was disappointed that there were not many sanitizer stations near food vendors. There were numerous sanitizer stations in and near gift shops, in attractions, and in stationary exhibits. I feel it's important to have sanitizer stations in all entrances to restaurants and food vendors. Even in restaurants, hand sanitizer, was few and far between."
200,2016-4,"So I’ve always loved Universal Studios and I took my wife yesterday 4/10/21 for her first time and she is pregnant so she couldn’t ride any rides but she was able to wait in line with me, except for the last ride of our day which was the Hulk Coaster. I waited well over an hour to only find out that the ride has temporarily suspended operations due to inclement weather. About 20 minutes passed and here comes my wife with one of the employees just to check on me and thank God because I was getting worried about her but I was so close to the front of the line and wanted to wait a little while to see what happens, so that put me in a dilemma. The employee let her stay with me and then about 10 minutes later, Ashley, one of the managers came and told my wife she had to “get out of her line”, with such a rude attitude about it. We told her the situation and she knew about it but still said she could not stay with me. I was pretty ticked off at the way she was talking to us. I know she was doing her job but there definitely is a better way to handle a situation and that was not it. After waiting an hour and half I ended up getting out of line with my wife mainly because I did NOT like the way we were just treated. It killed my mood from the whole day and that’s just not right. Universal, you really should train your employees and managers on people skills. I would like for you to resolve this matter by actually talking to Ashley about this because that attitude was highly unprofessional and unacceptable."
201,2016-4,"We were super excited to go and get lost in Diagon Alley and Hogsmead. We knew going the first week in April we would be dealing with crowds and extended wait times, however what we experienced in the parks was absolute chaos.  Aside from the initial temperature check, their enforcement of social distancing and mask wearing was a joke.  Bring your own hand sanitizer and something to wipe off tables. Plan on everything taking 3 times longer than what you expected.  If you're expecting limited capacity.... think again.  I witnessed a woman pass out cold in a line. We screamed and yelled for help, there was not a staff member within ear shot, it took over 10 minutes for someone to come to assist her.  I'll never go back. The park was filthy, completely over crowded and we rode a total of 2 rides. Never again."
202,2016-4,4/9/2021 - The park has a recording about face mask which they do not require guest to do. This is unlike Disney which requires guest to maintain 6 feet and wear a mask at all times except for eating or drinking while sitting. This park was a horrible experience for me and my family.
203,2016-5,Please do not make the mistake we made thinking there will not be that many people since you have to choose your ticket dates. That park was so crazy and crowded. Social distancing is nonexistent. We wasted money thinking this would be enjoyable for our daughters birthday. Highly disappointed.
204,2016-5,A great theme park for thrill seekers and Harry Potter fans of course. Great fun for all ages and our family loved the theme park a bunch. Volcano bay is a great place to visit for water park fun.
205,2016-5,"This will probably be our last time to Universal. We have been here several times before. We like the rides and this time was no exception. However we had some problems. I am going to mix a little advice into this review in hopes that it helps others have a better time and Universal to think about a few things.  First, get park to park tickets and give yourself at least 2 days to enjoy the rides and different aspects of the parks. Second, get express passes. You will either need to purchase them or you will get them included if you stay at one of the 3 on-park exclusive hotels that include them. This time we stayed at the HardRock. Without express passes you will not have a good time. Third, get to the park early at least one day so you have time to relax in the afternoon at your hotel pool. Fourth, if you are going to eat at a restaurant in the City Walk you should make reservations 3-4 weeks in advance. Fifth, best lunch by far was the Thunder Falls Terrace in Islands of Adventure. We got the chicken rice bowls. Great flavors and it is basically the same cost as a hotdog and chips and we did not need to wait an hour for our food. Sixth, skip Fast & Furious - Supercharged!!!!  We stayed at the HardRock which I mentioned above. We stayed 2 nights 3 days. That meant we got express passes for 3 days. That is the best part! We arrived Tuesday March 30th and left Thursday April 1st. Tuesday and Wednesday seemed a little less crowded. Thursday was very busy. As park hotel guests we do not need to wait in the standby line. We can get in early, leave, and get back into the parks without any wait. Express Passes meant we were able to ride a lot and usually waited 15 minutes or less in line. However, it seemed that express passes got poor treatment at The Mummy. We were not happy about that but there were plenty of other rides.  Hagrid's is a great ride but it is Virtual Line pass only. Express does not work for that ride and that ride alone. As hotel park guests we get early park entry and you can get in a standard line for Hagrid's. They closed that line at 8am and then it went virtual line only. The virtual line experience is total crap. It is one of the big reasons we will not be back. We had 4 people with smart phones and checked at very specific times for extra ride slots and out of 3 days we got one extra ride.  Social distancing is not enforced and there were too many people let in to the parks. Mask wearing was actually very good and the park employees were very good about reminding people to wear masks and how to actually wear them.  Universal... first, what were you thinking with the Fast & Furious ride? It is the worst ride / virtual ride and if we didn't have express passes this review would have been far worse. Second, people should not need to wait an hour in line to order food and then for it to take another hour for that food to be ready. There were lines at every place to order drink or food. If you are going to let so many people into the park you need to make sure that you have enough food and beverage stations available."
206,2016-5,Visited the park during covid and didn't feel overwhelmed. The attendants reinforced the mask policy and that was more than appreciated.
207,2016-5,The park is a bit overwhelming for a first timer and very chaotic! That being said I was there at a very busy time of year spring break still in full swing! We did not do everything as lines where long and we didn’t care to be at the parks till all hours of night. The transformers ride was great my child liked the mummy ride also! There was a woody wood pecker land for smaller children we just walked through. We did the classic ET ride very nice nostalgic piece. Now Diagon Ally or however you say it was amazingly themed the escape from greengots ride was great! This section of the park was not Chaotically themed but very busy with people rightly so it was universals crowned jewel for sure. Overall I will be back someday. If you have early park admission or get express pass take advantage during these busy times the wait times get crazy at this place.
208,2016-5,I am currently on hold with Customer Service in order to change my payment options for a booked vacation. I have now been on hold for 1 hour and 52 minutes. This is absolutely unacceptable. Never have I sat on hold this long for anything! Unbelievable!!
209,2016-5,"I was really unhappy with our day at Universal. The park was dirty, the employees were mostly unkind, social distancing was not encouraged or enforced and the park was packed to the brim. This was in March of 2021. It is hard to find somewhere to sit. All of their popular rides require you to enter into a virtual queue early in the morning. Something else our party did not know was that you cannot ride on basically any ride with your personal belongings. For rides like the Hulk, this makes sense to me. But a ride like Men in Black?? It would not have been a big deal EXCEPT my boyfriend had a backpack that does not fit in their free lockers. So we paid $2 for a bigger locker. Basically it felt like we were paying $2 to ride rides at a park we paid $200 to be at already. Mind you, we rode almost every ride in all four Disney parks this same week. Not once was his backpack an issue at Disney. We really do not care for Universal after this and we would all recommend Disney 10x over Universal for a pleasant, clean, FUN experience. Universal was not fun for us at all."
210,2016-5,"Universal City Walk was a total rip off. $26 for parking. Screening worse than airports--they confiscated my little mini sherry in my airline plastic bag. Long waits to get into restaurants. Small drink kiosks were ridiculously expensive. With covid way too many people, no social distancing, some people without masks. Would never go again."
211,2016-5,Don't sell more tickets then the park can handle even if they are still under covid restrictions. Purchased tickets before entering park. Had to go into a stand by entry line for 3 hrs. Park said they were at max capacity. Which when we finally got our turn to go in they were limiting entry to 12 people every 5 mins. Shouldn't have had to pay full price for 2/3rds of a day
212,2016-5,"Absolutely horrible experience- Universal should be ashamed of themselves for overselling tickets. Volcano Bay(which opens to the general public at 10 am) was already at capacity at 9:30 am !!! By the time we tried to go to one of the other parks instead, they were at capacity too!!! We work hard to afford a vacation and now it is ruined. Save yourself the pain and stay FAR away from Universal. We will never be back sadly."
213,2016-5,Mardi Gras this year was amazing! Food was great! The performers and staff seemed to be having fun despite the fact it was incredibly crowded. One of our favorite places to vacation!
214,2016-5,"Universal is complete crap, very dirty, not safe, no places to sit, no social distancing, no hand sanitizer, 2-3 hour waits for one ride, just complete garbage. They say they're limiting people in the park but that's a lie, they're not regulating the covid safety measures that they keep screaming in your ear on the overhead. We got to ride 2 rides in 8 hours time, waits for food were ridiculous. People were passing out due to lack of access to water and rest areas. Just garbage, spend your money at Disney instead, way more worth it."
215,2016-5,"Had a great time during Spring Break with my sons - ages 11 and 9. We stayed at the Loews Royal Pacific Hotel for 2 reasons - the Jurassic Park suite (super cute) and the express passes. We did the 3 park, 4 day pass, but with the express tickets you could probably do everything in 2 really full days.  Loews Royal Pacific Hotel: We arrived around 1:30 pm after taking the Universal Shuttle from the airport. We actually rode in a tour bus and the driver told us about the area and did some trivia with us. I would do that again. Luckily when we arrived, our room was ready so we could go right to our room. I booked the Jurassic Park suite as a surprise to my kids and they loved it. I enjoyed having my separate space. We were on the ground level so cell reception wasn't the greatest, but the free wi-fi worked well. Despite the Jurassic Park room, the hotel wasn't overly kid friendly with the styling and pool. I expected there to be some slides into the pool or something, but it was just a large pool. They did have a kids area with some water spraying - my sons only played there about 5 minutes. We ordered food from Jake's American Bar and ate it in our room (I wasn't impressed with the in room dining menu). The food was fine - not overly impressive. Another night we had dinner by the pool at the Bula Bar and Grill - I really enjoyed their food, especially the nachos. Our server was really attentive as well. I would have eaten there again had we had time. The other wonderful feature at the hotel was they had an Avis car rental directly in the lobby. They brought the car to the front of the hotel so the convenience couldn't be beat. Each morning - they checked your temperature and gave you a wristband. This way you didn't have to do it at park security. We also took advantage of the water taxi coming back from the parks on two occasions. That is a really nice feature and the wait was never too long for a boat. The last day it was not in operation due to the weather - I guess the water was too choppy (that was too bad because our feet were tired at the end of the week). The signs around the resort were helpful and very clear. It was easy to know which way to go, like to the bus for Volcano Bay.  Volcano Bay: In theory, they have a great system but there are kinks that need to be worked out. They give you this Tapu Tapu band where you can reserve a time for a water slide, but you can only do one attraction at a time. So if one has a 120 minute wait, you can't do any other water slides during that time that also would require a return time. While there are other things you can do while you wait - like the lazy river, adventure river, and wave pool, it doesn't make sense that you couldn't at least have 2 slide reservations at a time. Waiting 120 minutes between slides is crazy. Also - just because it says 120 minutes when you reserve your time, doesn't mean that is the actual time. My sons and I tapped at the same time. When we got to 60 minutes, 40 minutes was added back to their time but mine stayed the same. I asked a staff member about it and they said it would sync back - the system was just trying to handle over 400 people at a time. It did eventually sync back - by adding 40 minutes to my time. When it got back to 60 minutes again, I began tracking it against my watch and while the Tapu incremented in 5 minute intervals, it did not match 5 minutes on the watch. It could take 10 or so minutes to go down by 5 minutes. So your 120 minute wait could actually be a lot more. We were waiting to do the water coaster and it kept extending our day (and again, we couldn't do any other water slides during that time). I again asked a staff member and they said that at times when there are delays or system issues, time is added. I get a few minutes, but not the additional hour we had to wait. My son's Tapu came off on one of the water slides and we had to get a replacement and it wasn't clear where to get it from - we got different answers from various staff members. I did like that you could link a Tapu to your credit card via the app so that you didn't have to carry money when buying food, etc. The only other complaint I have is that the park was somewhat confusing - it was hard finding the various attractions' tapu sites and then entrances. Also, some slides allowed water shoes and others didn't. The main saving grace of Volcano Bay was the adventure river - you get a life jacket and get into a more rapid lazy river. It was a lot of fun and we spent quite a bit of our wait time in there since they didn't limit how many times you could go around.  City Walk - we didn't spend much time here since we aren't really into shopping and many of the food places were ones we could get locally or had been to other places. We did go to the Chocolate Emporium for dessert - that was great. This is also where you get the water taxi.  Universal Studios - we took advantage of the early entrance and did the Minion Ride and Harry Potter ride first thing. They had a Mardi Gras theme going on while we were there and my son enjoyed catching beads from all of the floats. We didn't take advantage of those food carts because my sons aren't adventurous eaters. I love the decorations in Universal Studios - there are so many picture opportunities and it's just really well done. Due to COVID, we did have to wear our mask but we took frequent stationary drink breaks to get some relief. Luckily it wasn't too hot on our visit- I'm sure on hotter days, it is very difficult to wear. We used the Express Pass to our advantage over the several days we were there. It makes such a difference in how much you can see and do while there. The rides are great, but I can't see standing in line an hour or so for a 2 minute attraction. The one area where the Express Pass failed was the Hogwarts Express - that line was extremely long and it didn't seem to make much difference to have the pass, there was still a long queue line. The locker areas throughout the park could get crowded at times so they easily adjusted and said only one person per party in the locker area - that helped quite a bit. The Harry Potter area was very tight - and my kids couldn't take full advantage of the wands I bought them which is too bad. Men in Black is still one of my favorite rides and we rode that multiple times until we reached Galaxy Defender title. The food lines were extremely long - we waited 45 minutes for lunch in the Simpsons area - there were plenty of empty tables so I questioned why the wait. The greeter said the restaurant wasn't staffed for the number of tables they had. The food was fine though - standard park fare, definitely seemed on the high side for price when compared to other amusement parks. I really liked the mobile ordering and payment - that way we could be seated while we ordered and paid rather than standing in a queue. There were workers throughout the park reminding people to wear their masks fully and they had people wiping down railings, etc. I liked that they gave hand sanitizer to everyone before they got on the ride. I saw them spray some rides in between people, but not everytime which I appreciated. I was at another place last summer where they sanitized every seat in between customers which made the wait extremely long. They also had hand sanitizer available after the ride for anyone that wanted it.  Islands of Adventure - we took advantage of the early entry at this park to get to the Hagrid's Motorbike ride since it doesn't take the express pass. Both times, we had to wait about 90 minutes, but that ride is definitely worth it. My kids enjoyed the butterbeer several times- make sure you check both sides of the cart, many times people were lined up in one line not realizing there was also a shorter line on the other side. The Harry Potter area was again crowded, but the kids were able to use their wands in this section. The water rides will get you wet - especially the barge one where you sit in the circular raft - we did not have a dry spot on us after that ride. We tried to use a People Dryer but it took my $5 without turning on and I could not find someone to help us with that. Luckily the sun dried us for the most part. It was too bad the shows were closed due to COVID. We enjoyed our time in this park - my sons liked that there was more variety in the type of rides in this park vs Universal Studios."
216,2016-5,"We flew in from California after we were vaccinated. Luckily the Mardi Gras festival was going on because the rest of the food is mediocre. The pizza line is ridiculous. Only one employee in the booth taking orders & serving. I waited over 45 minutes for pre-made & pre-sliced pizza. The worst experience was on Hogwarts express by the employee Bennie. We had express tickets & were next in line when Bennie gave us a dirty look for going up to the front gate when the blue line was apparently 6 feet back. Then part of a large party of 17 came up the elevator. He pulled them to the side, allowed more party members to go up & down the elevator & loaded them on the next train effectively allowing them to skip to the front of the line. When I questioned why, he had no valid reason. They were not VIP. Was it racism (we are Latinx)? Was it passive aggressiveness? Power trip? Did he think we were non-English speakers? Either way, his weak apology was a major miss and frustration. Also, get here early. The park was at capacity by 11:30 a.m."
217,2016-5,"The last time I was here and reviewed the park, was back in 2008. I felt like it was time for another visit and another review. Keep in mind that we went during Covid, so things might be a little different, but we had an absolute blast here. The kids are 11 and 8, so they were old enough to rides all of the rides, plus they had seen most of the movies that the themes were based on, so everything worked out great. Universal did a great job with mask enforcement, handing out hand sanitizer, and trying to mark lines to keep people socially distant. The fact that some people don't follow the rules isn't their fault.  Like I mentioned in my previous review, Universal does an amazing job of giving you a story to look at while you are waiting in line for a ride. So, even though we had the Express Passes, we would stop to look around at all there was to see in the ride queues. Express Passes make this place even better. You will save so much time and be able to see and do so much more if you have it. The Bourne Stunt show and the Horror Makeup show are both really fun to see. The rides here that are great are: The Mummy, Transformers, Simpsons, Men In Black, and oddly enough, the Jimmy Fallon Tonight Show ride.  Do yourself a favor and come spend a day here, it is worth it.  My only negative is it is very hard to properly enjoy the Wizarding World of Harry Potter because of the number of people that flock straight there. The parks are at a limited capacity and I still thought it was overly crowded in Diagon Alley. I can't imagine how bad it was before the limits were in place."
218,2016-5,Be sure to be there SUPER EARLY (park opens at 8am) to enjoy your day. We went for spring break as expected a lot of waiting on line at 7am ( premier pass perks) . Everywhere was being cleaned and sanitized. I bought the 15 month 3 park premier passes which is totally worth it if your going on vacation to florida a few times a year. No blackout dates and parking included except the 1st parking you must pay while you get your pass. The best part of the premier pass is that you get the fast pass included after 4pm on all rides once daily. THE GREATEST FEATURE. My teenager LOVED IT. Her first time in Universal Studios. Super expensive food and souvenirs but to be expected as it is Universal. $18 for a magnet. $15 for a cup $15 lanyard $20 for a meal. It gets pricey. They do allow you to bring snacks and water.
219,2016-5,"The park is beautiful, clean, attentive with attentive staff. It is wonderfully decorated with great attention to detail, some of it (Harry Potter attractions, Simpson's Springfield) are visually stunning. The food inside the park was fantastic. The rides are some of the best I've ever been on (and I have had the pleasureof visiting many popular amusement parks countrywide). BUT, the lines are INSANE!!! Lines for rides were on average 2 hrs long!! Some more than that. Not just the rides, there were outrageous lines for food, shows, etc.. completely ruins the experience, and some rides you can't even get on because they shut you out if you don't get virtual pass?? You pay around $100 a ticket, so a family of 4 you are looking at $400 just to get in the door, and you spend literally half of your day standing in lines, which leads to sore feet and cranky kids! Universal needs to really get their act together and figure thus out."
220,2016-5,"Great park, I prefer Islands of Adventure to Universal Studios but both are nice to visit. This park seems more laid back than Islands of Adventure."
221,2016-5,We went on Thursday last week. I wish I would have checked reviews and saved the money. Most of the rides we did were pretty cool. No problem there. Even though the lines were ridiculous they moved pretty quickly. However most of the employees are rude. I have no problem with the mask mandates. We wore them and even managed to get one on our 4 yr old during the rides. What I have a problem with is the fact that employees will be rude to you for having your mask down while standing still and not even near another group. The girl at the Shrek ride was very rude towards my husband and myself for it on separate occasions while you had multiple other groups doing the same and nothing said about it. Another incident the employee wasn’t rude but we were waiting for the King Kong ride to be fixed away from all other groups and he came over to tell us we couldn’t vape there and had to go to a designated smoking area. I can understand if we were near other people or it was cigarettes that smell and leave litter but that’s not the case so doesn’t really make sense. Overall you are paying high prices for limited activities and to be hassled by rude employees. I wouldn’t be as aggravated if employees were taught how to handle situations more discreetly and politely.
222,2016-5,"Keep in mind that I am 77 and have never seen most of the movies that form the canvas that this theme park is painted on. That said, the place can be very entertaining for children and teens - especially since they are immersed in the pop culture that the Hollywood studios crank out, and especially since cost is of no consequence to them. In the end, the difference in age dictates the level of enjoyment one receives from a visit here. The walking distances and the standing for hours in long lines is a game for strong healthy youngsters, it is tiring and exhausting for those of us past 55. The costs associated with a visit here are mind numbing and at every turn there are unexpected and incremental charges that one never is able to plan for. For a family of four we easily burned through a grand per day with nothing extraordinary added on. None the less, the kids were excited and devoured all the rides and exhibits and ate endless amounts of fast foods and desserts - they had not a single complaint.  I would say two days here is plenty and I would reccomend staying in one of the park hotels, it simplifies what is otherwise a complex logistical undertaking. I also would tell anyone to buy the express tickets which allows you to move through a much faster queue - you will still wait for 20-45 minutes but that is twice the speed of the general line movement.  As for social distancing, the park tries hard, but in the end the crush of humanity is unavoidable, you will be face to face with strangers on many occassions while you trek endlessly through the waiting lines. I would say I am glad I went, but it was exhausting."
223,2016-5,I get it Spring Break... What I don't get is why social distancing was not a thing. Packed like sardines in most places and lines staggered when easy I'm not sure there was much planning. No rides wiped down after use and again the crowds being insane. Glad I had a vaccine.  Staff was excellent and still very nice. That's the one star here. I'm more impressed by the smaller parks in Orlando that at least wipe down the rides after every guest. It can be done.
224,2016-6,Our family has been here many times and we always have so much fun no matter the time of year or how busy it is. The rides are awesome. The food is good. The staff is great. One suggestion I have is to stay at a Universal property for the extra perks as well.
225,2016-6,"Our Favorite Playground! We spent three days at the park. The only downside was the distance you had to walk from the parking deck to get to the gate. It took forever! We were there last spring during Mardi Gras and were treated to a great parade. The ride lines were reasonable although COVID had just reared its ugly head when we visited. Harry Potter's World was fantastic! There just isn't anything bad to say about the park. This was the last ""big park"" we visited and we liked it most."
226,2016-6,First of all the park is so cool. Very well maintained. The rides we did ride were quite fun. Some negative rides were king kong and fast and furious. Lots of potential but a big let down. We absolutely loved the rocket and mummy. My biggest complaint is the virtual line. We were there for four days and tried pretty much non stop to get a spot for hagrids motorcycle ride. The easy fix would b to have both a physical line and a virtual one. Only opening up the absolute 4 tumes a day is ridiculous. U have thousands of people trying to log in virtually for a few time slots. This is totally unacceptable. The park is so expensive and to limit someone's ability to ride everything is unfair. It is now the middle of our last day and once again we are trying to get time slots for the Hagrid ride. Trying to explain that we can't ride it because there is not any times available toan 8yr old is not easy. We will probably not return until the virtual line fiasco is fixed. It makes for a very dissapointing experience.
227,2016-6,"We love universal studios and islands of adventures. We go annually and always have the best time. Splurge for the unlimited fast pass, it’s worth it. Universal really understands crowd management, they are excellent at moving large numbers of people. This park is worth the trip to Orlando!"
228,2016-6,"This was my first visit back to Universal Orlando in 20 years with my last visit being back in 2001, before any of the Harry Potter stuff was even around. I was so glad to finally return. The park was at capacity when we arrived on the first day, but the stand by line was only about an hour to get in which went pretty quick. As long as you know how to use the virtual queue system and what rides get the longest waits at certain parts of the day, you can still ride everything within a few days. We got the 4 day park hopper tickets good for both Universal parks and Volcano Bay. If you want a ride on Hagrid's, make sure to get your reservation on the park app at 8am, 11am, 2pm, or 4pm. If you are not on there right on those times, the time slots will be gone. Hagrid's is a MUST too. Definitely one of the coolest roller coasters I have ever been on. Diagon Alley at Universal and Hogsmeade over at Islands of Adventure are linked together with the Hogwarts Express, which you will need a park hopper pass to jump between. They scan your park tickets when you get in the queue for the Hogwarts Express. Make sure to take the train BOTH ways too as it is different each way! The Harry Potter everything is...pure magical. Busy...but still very enjoyable the intricate detail to EVERYTHING will blow your mind!! The stand by lines do get long but the incredible theming in the queue lines make the waits entertaining. That and the fact that Universal does over post on most of their wait times. They do this to make people happier! An hour wait will really be about 45 minutes...or less. A 30 minute wait is usually about 15 minutes, etc. This is an amazing system that they use! Waiting to the end of the day (last hour or so) most waits will be very short. Jurassic Park is great at the end of the day too as it is the longest midday when people want to cool off. Plus it is totally different at night! Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey is the most UNIQUE dark ride I have ever been on....by far. I won't spoil it but this is a must -do. You will find yourself staring at Hogwarts Castle due to its pure beauty. Make sure to see it all lit up at night as well. VelociCoaster looks incredible and I cannot wait to ride this. Jimmy Fallon is pretty cool although I am still salty they replaced the classic Twister attraction with this. Men in Black Alien Attack was a blast...no pun intended! Loved getting spun around shooting at the aliens competing for the highest score. The Simpsons ride was pretty cool, although may eventually need updated. The Mummy Returns has a virtual queue option so utilize this if there are time slots available. E.T is always great! Rip Ride RockIt is fun but choose your song quick as I was not fast enough so it chose for me as we approached the lift hill. The Hulk, Spiderman, and Reign of Kong over at Islands of Adventure are all fantastic! Make sure to eat at the Three Broomsticks in Hogsmeade too. The line was wrapped all the way around and to the back but we still got seated within about 30 minutes. Pretty much all the Universal restaurants require mobile ordering where you order and pay on your phone via the Universal app and they bring your food out and you take it off the trays. This eliminates any touching. Masks are still required in the parks but hopefully with vaccines rolling out, this mandate won't be around much longer. Parking does take awhile, but once you're through the toll booths, it clears up and you are parked pretty quick. Make sure to note what section you parked in. Another absolute MUST is to watch the end of the day ""Celebrations"" waterfront show at 9:45pm. This is a high energy fountain show mixed with fireworks and projections all around you that bring you right into the movies. It was absolutely incredible!! I definitely will not let it be another 20 years before I return to Universal Orlando. It was a fantastic 4 days!"
229,2016-6,"The workers were rude and spent the entire day yelling at the few people whose masks fell below their noses instead of actually doing their jobs. I never saw any of them cleaning. Wait times for food were much longer than ever in the past. The park didn’t seem any less crowded than usual. Their covid measures seemed to only entail lazily yelling at guests all day. Most people really had masks on appropriately and the policing was unnecessary. The rides were also ruined with them constantly calling out over the actual sound provided for the ride to remind people about masks. They even reminded guests who had masks on appropriately. It was crazy. They need to remember that some guests may require a break with all the walking to catch their breath, especially older guests. How did they know whether or not some of the people they were yelling at had medical conditions. I was shocked at the way people around me were treated."
230,2016-6,"We spent one day at Universal and Islands of Adventure with the park to park tickets. 2 adults and 2 kids age 11 and 8. We stayed one night at Hard Rock Hotel, which included the Express Passes and despite the high price they were worth EVERY PENNY! As expected, the parks were packed because of it being spring break season. We never would’ve been able to ride all that we did without the Express Passes. We had early access due to staying on Universal property and went straight to Hagrids Motorbike. The longest we waited all day was 2 hours for Hagrids, but no passes can be used on that ride. Otherwise, we waited between 0 and 15 minutes the rest of the day, riding every ride we wanted to. It was a great day with lots of memories made!  I would like to give credit to Nelson and Dan at the Raptor Encounter. We waited in the line for about 25 min and were rushed through by the man running the encounter. I wanted a photo of my kids together and then one of each of them separately. My son also wanted the separate photo because he loves Jurassic World and didn’t want his sister in his picture with Blue! Lol. Anyway, we were rushed through before I could take the separate photos. My husband spoke with Nelson and Dan at the entrance to the encounter about what happened and Nelson told us to come back at a specific time and we could get our photos. When my husband brought the kids back, Nelson gave them a private encounter with a baby raptor, as well as another chance at photos with Blue. He went above and beyond for us. Amazing customer service!!!! We were beyond pleased!"
231,2016-6,This is the worst trip I've ever been on..... Social NOTso-distancing. Greed over safety. What count do they say is 50% of ? It is PACKED !! WORSE THEN HOLIDAYS. Just not worth it. At all. Staff is managing excellent this one star for them !!!
232,2016-6,"As life long Harry Potter fans my husband and I were thrilled to do the wand experience. We were not told that only 1 person in a party of 2 would be chosen for the experience. After waiting 5 hours for our cued timed we went in, my husband started recording the scene because we were both so excited. I received my wand. Then turned around to record him receiving his and we were abruptly kicked out of the “experience”. There was no warning or explanation until we were out of the shop. We had EVERY INTENTION on purchasing our wands from the experience, but after being treated so negatively we left that section of the park. Something needs to be changed about the experience. Wand Sales would probably boom if the experience was actually magical."
233,2016-6,"We had two amazing days at the park. Universal really treats families great especially with young children. The Harry Potter experience is very well done. Escape from grigots, hagrids the hulk and the rock and roll roller coaster are a must. Don’t waste your time on fast and furious definitely the worst ride at the park.  I know express pass seems expensive but it is absolutely worth every penny.  Butterbeer was a huge hit with our Potter fans.  Voodoo doughnuts are no better than dunkin or Krispy Cream.  Go to the ice cream parlor in diagon alley and the wand experience for our huge Potter fan daughter was great.  The train is a must .  Overall the experience was great. Ty to Johnthan in guest service you were awesome."
234,2016-6,"Great theme park for fun rides and adventure. Just didn't like the fast pass customers. We stood in line 2and a half hours for one ride ( Rock it Roller Coaster). Yes, the ride was great but the line was not. I do recommend Universal studios for a fun time with the family or Solo."
235,2016-6,"We stayed at the Dockside Universal hotel. Overall it wasn't a bad stay. But.....there's alway a big BUT.... there were some snafus. There was a long line when we got there late in the evening. The last thing we wanted was to wait in a long line. Well, we had to wait in a long line at the front counter. One girl working. Then, our reservations were messed up. Both our families were supposed to be in connecting rooms. That didn't happen. The front service representative got us two rooms down the hall from each other on opposite sides of the corridor. But, she was very pleasant, empathetic and apologetic about it. We had lots of luggage. The last thing we didn't want was to drag luggage up to the 4th floor. We went to the luggage area. They said there were no luggage carriers around and they didn't know where they were at. All they could tell us was that there were several somewhere throughout the hotel but couldn't tell us where. We then had to drag all the luggage upstairs by hand. A lot of walking for a large hotel. This was after a long tiring day of travel. Not what we were expecting or wanted. There was also long lines for elevators because of COVID protocols. After getting luggage to the room, we then went back downstairs to get something to eat. But, the downstairs food area was starting to close. As many people that were still in there around 11:00PM they probably could have left it open till 12:00AM and still would have been busy. No problems with loud ruckus or music. Slept well. Everything was fairly clean. The bus transport from hotel to Universal and back was efficient. No problem there. Staff took all sorts of pandemic measures including temp checks and making sure everyone wore their masks around the hotel and parks. One thing that I thought was very annoying that ended up causing a riff between a family member and a Universal staff member was figuring out where the child swap pick up area was at for rides. If you had a baby or child that couldn't go on a ride you could all go up together and then one or two could stay behind with the baby. When the first family group got done with the ride the rest could jump to the head of the line and get on the ride and typically not have to wait long in line. More or less jumping ahead of everyone else. After getting off the the Kong ride staff were ushering you quickly to get you out of there. We thought maybe the rest of our party was waiting outside. They weren't. We went back into the exit part of the ride. My son-in-law went under the rope to get to where he thought our daughter was with the baby. Oh my gosh, an older Universal staff member jumped all over him and told him he didn't know where he was going. My son-in-law said exactly, I don't, because you all rush people along and out the exit and don't make things clear where the connecting parties are located. I personally thought the way the older gentleman handle this situation was not professional. I felt he could have addressed this with my son-in-law in a much less confrontational and empathetic approach. He automatically assumed he was doing something bad and didn't ask what he needed, why he was going the way he was headed or asked if he could help him. This was the case with many of the child swap situation on rides. It's very confusing because on some rides the child swap area is back outside somewhere and then sometimes it could be inside somewhere. If you are going to use the child swap option please make sure you get decisive answers of where the party getting off the ride is supposed to meet the rest of the family party that is waiting. Very confusing and I feel the staff assumes everyone understands where you need to go. They work there. That's their office. They know it well. Here comes someone new to the park that has very little knowledge and they're trying to figure things out. The last thing they need on a vacation which is supposed to be fun is someone yelling at them at the very place they're suppose to have fun at. So between the hotel snafus and the some confusion and an altercation sat the park, overall, it wasn't bad."
236,2016-6,"It was beyond expectations. Yea, the lines were long but they do give you the option to pay and get the express pass. Also the waiting areas for most rides are amazing. They’ve gone above and beyond to make sure the visitors don’t get bored and stay occupied in the queues. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter was certainly the highlight. Going to the park is worth it just for that alone. We visited all the three parks and would love to do it all over again!"
237,2016-6,"Bought Universal Harry Potter Experience Package. It was a waste. There was no benefit to purchasing the package. We had no preference for rides, food or experiences. Trying to get on rides was very difficult due to crowds. This would have been much better had the package included some type of preference as part of the package. The advertising was very deceiving."
238,2016-6,"TripAdvisor was AMAZING. Universal was a bunch of maskhole virtue signalers who were so “concerned” about covid that’s why the face diaper they tried to enforce constantly was very annoying and not worth the $650 we spent on tickets. Wake up people!!!! Masks will not “protect” you on rides packed with people or anywhere else. Why are healthy people masking? Are we afraid they will spread and share their good health?! Insert eye roll here. They ruined the experience for my kids by constantly telling all of us to wear or to pick up their masks. Also, kids are out of school, migrants are pouring into our country but Universal Studios is open?!!!!!! Don't worry, your mask will save you from a virus with a 99.9% survival rate. Heres an idea, for those that want to wear masks and socially distance, stay home. You don't get Universal or any other place you are too scared to catch a 99.9% survival rate virus!"
239,2016-6,"My wife and I spent the day at one park. We pre-purchased the tickets before our trip but we showed up on the wrong day. Went to Customer Services to have our tickets changed for that day, but Universal CHARGED US AN EXTRA $30.00 just to stay for the day. I didn't understand why, the park was already full of people? They gave the excuse it was because of crowd control! After did the temperature test, and got in, they had NO physical park maps!!! They told use we needed to use our cell phones. REALLY! Never been to a theme park that didn't have a map for their guests! The park was wall to wall people (so much for crowd control). the wait times for the rides was 60 - 90 minutes or LONGER - we only went on 4 rides. HORRABLE experience, go to Bush Gardens instead."
240,2016-6,"I was very happy with our time at Universal. We had the unlimited express pass because we stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel. Yes, it was expensive, but time is money and we did notice the really long lines for standby. However, there is an outlet if you have an unlimited express pass and we did not wait more than 20 minutes for any ride during days parks were at capacity. We had so much fun and spent 2.5 days there and rode almost all the rides and did some shopping too. Disney, on the other hand, has no outlet they discontinued Fastpass and we had no choice but to wait in line and that is a bad experience. Honestly, Disney doesn't social distance either and they force you to wait in long lines with huge crowds. At Least Universal actively gives each person hand sanitizer and tries to at least make sure they do something. The hand sanitizer stations at Disney are far less and some don't even work. My suggestion is if you are going during a peak time you must have this express pass. It is hot and waiting in lines all day is not only exhausting but not fun at all."
241,2016-6,"Please read before booking your reservations to this theme park. I wish I would have done more research before we did...would have saved us $750+ Our family decided to take a mini vacation to Orlando this past weekend. Since we normally go to Disney Parks we decided to change things up and try Universal Studios. What a mistake.!!! The experience was horrible. Wait times for rides were on average 75min-120+min per ride. No social distancing as the park was overcrowded. We decided not to eat at the park since the lines were so terribly long and food was very expensive. We've never been to a theme park were the kids were actually begging to leave. We wanted to get some of our moneys worth so we stayed til 3pm and rode 4 rides total for the day. So I guess you can say we paid about $35 a ride on average per ride. The experience as a whole was not at all what we were anticipating. We all decided as a family we would never go back again. Universal Studios, you are going to need to make some serious changes so that you don't lose more customers."
242,2016-6,"I have always loved Universal Orlando and this year with COVID they had to adjust how they put together their Mardi Gras event and they REALLY did an amazing job! They offered the ability to try food from all over the world, the floats, people and environment was amazing! My friends and I had an absolute blast and will be visiting much more often!"
243,2016-6,"High cost, low value. Spent 800 for 6 tickets and then 26 for parking. Went on 4 rides since wait times exceeded 2 hours. The last ride was ET. It broke and they needed to rescue us. We were suspended about 40 feet in the air for about 30 minutes. My daughter was visibly shaking and crying after our rescue. They gave us a 1 ride express pass for our troubles... incredibly cheap. And as for the food, we paid 17 for a cheese burger and fries. Took 60 minutes and we only got it because we asked about the order otherwise they would of forgotten about us. Food was cold, probably sitting out 40 minutes. Worse customer experience I had in 65 years. Place is totally incompetent. Will never go back."
244,2016-6,Too much money too long of lines only to have ride shut down or part of the ride eliminated. In 12 hours of being in the park we did 6 rides and 3 were silly Dr. Seuss kiddie rides. The app is a joke and does not work properly fact confirmed by many staff. Skip the picture pass not near enough opportunities to be photographed. I will never be back.
245,2016-7,"We came to Orlando for 2 days to experience the Orlando and Disney. Parking was $50 for a close proximity to the park. We went into the park and were able to visit 2 rides for which we were on the lines for total of 1 hour (the rides were 2 mins each). No social distancing on lines by the way. On the third ride as we are waiting on line for the ride someone decides to cut the line in front of us. The people who were in front of us were calling up more family members up the line. We tried to ask them Politely not to do it.. they ignored us and kept calling more family members up the line. This led to a scuffle, which we did not initiate.. and did not even retaliate. WE CALLED ON SECURITY. For that we were thrown out of the park and banned for a year. My 3 year old missed on the experience and needless to say I don’t think we’re ever going back. They did not even offer money back for the park tickets.. in many years of us visiting different theme parks all over the world, we’ve never had such a horrible experience. STAY AWAY.. they might throw you out for looking at someone the wrong way."
246,2016-7,"Unbelievably horrible! We have to wait 2 hours just to get in! They should not sell that many tickets if you can’t admit a paying customer. Waisted have the damn day. No explanation, just had to wait in line. People were leaving like crazy and they still made angry customers wait in line. I understand there is a pandemic, so you shouldn’t sell so many tickets. It isn’t rocket science!"
247,2016-7,The main thing that did not lip about this park was how with some rides it was hard to tell where the entrance was or where the line began or ended. I will say I likes this park a little more than Islanda of Adventure since it wasn't as crowded. Worth the money? Definitely not. If you dont have an express pass you can forget it and they were more than the park admission smh.
248,2016-7,"The hospitality experience from all angles was absolutely phenomenal! Of course the rides were everything we imagined, but what stuck out most to me was hospitality from the staff. The one person who made a great impression on the park was Hollie on the Universal Park side. She stood out there on one of the corners, and what went from the occasional ""where is this located"" turned into a wonderful conversation about the park, what rides to get on now before they become too crowded, the best rides between both parks, the suggestive selling to upgrade to both parks (totally recommend for only $60 per person), and the flat out friendliness. Completely made our day. If that wasn't enough, as we were walking away, she shouted, MAKE SURE YOU GET THE BUTTER BEER! You can tell she loves people, and it showed. If she can read this, the Fast & Furious ride was mediocre compared to the ones mentioned. You're not missing much unless you're a die hard F&F fan."
249,2016-7,"My wife and I have been to Disney MULTIPLE times so we thought that we'd try out Universal Studios without our kids. In our opinion, this should not even be called an ""Amusement"" park. The value of entertainment that you receive for the high price of admission and parking is very low compared to other options such as all of the Disney parks or even a place like FunSpot. Universal only has 1 true roller coaster, which was closed on the day that we went due to high winds, and every other ride is some sort of Virtual Reality experience. For my money I'd rather go to Cedar Point in Ohio and ride 10+ roller coasters all day than spend $120+ on a ticket here."
250,2016-7,"Totally worth it, especially during a busy time like spring break. We were in a group of 11 including our own kids (6 and 7) a teenager in another party and the rest adults. Our tour guide Kristi was awesome. Our 6yo was too short for some things and 7yo too skittish for some things and they still had a great time - our group got along great and the non-thrillseekers enjoyed watching the thrill seekers get gforce-smooshed on mega coasters. Kristi even entertained the kids while us parents went on the Forbidden Journey. Breakfast & lunch at cafe la bamba was great. Some rides broke down while we were enroute & guide Kristi adjusted on the fly. In the end we went on:  Fast and the Furious Race through New York Forbidden Journey Escape from Gringotts Hagrids Magical Motorbikes Hogwarts Express (twice) Spiderman The Hulk Hollywood Rip Ride Rocket Bourne Stuntacular Transformers  By evening time lines were shorter & after the tour we used express pass access to hit lots of other rides in rapid succession.  We stayed 3 more days after the tour (no express passes or anything) and made great use of time, knowing what we wanted to do a 2nd or 3rd time.  Would do it again & totally recommend."
251,2016-7,"Worst “vacation” I’ve ever been on. How in the world can fast passes cost $300 per person and per park!?! Yet advertised as starting at $69. My family of 4 for 2 park days would’ve cost us $2400 just for fast passes! And how can you have the most popular ride (hagrid) as a virtual wait only and not give the option to wait in line? Because it was impossible to get a virtual time slot. Why isn’t this communicated before purchasing tickets? The wait times in general are ridiculous. Also the amount of times the staff asked my 4 year old to put his mask over his nose was over the top. I understand guidelines and we tried our best to keep it on him but it got ridiculous. We wouldn’t even be near people and a staff member would walk over to tell him. 2 staff members who thought they were funny on a sound system with a microphone called him out as he had his water bottle in his hand drinking! And to recommend the Avanti Palm resort as an affiliated hotel says a lot about your customer service. That place is a complete dump. We tried to get our reservations changed but couldn’t get anyone to help us out for about 6 hours total on the phone!!!! By then, it was too late to wake up our 2 children and change hotels. We couldn’t take the overwhelming smell of weed and complete lack of cleanliness! It was so disgusting we left the second day as soon as we exited the park and drove 6 hours home to avoid another night there. This was possibly the worst experience we’ve ever had any where. When a 4 year old and an 11 year old beg to leave and drive home, you know it’s bad! I think the worst part is, no one with Universal is willing to make it right. We will not be back."
252,2016-7,"Really enjoyed the park. Diagon Alley is outstanding. Also loved Revenge of the Mummy and Race through New York. We were staying on property so had the express passes and highly recommend them, they saved us so much time and allowed us to do our favorite rides multiple times. Two things could have been better. My husband and son stood in line for 45 minutes (with the express pass) for Rip Ride Rockit and got on the ride before someone decided to double check my son’s height, pulled him off the ride and decided he wasn’t quite tall enough. I wish they’d do these checks at the beginning of the line and also be more consistent (a kid smaller than him in front of them got on the ride no problem). The other frustrating thing was how hard it was to get food. Even the pretzel stands were a good 15-20 minute wait. And if you plan to sit down to eat, go at least an hour before you’re actually hungry. It took us 90 minutes to get some chicken fingers and a cheese pizza in the Simpsons area. Outside of those two issues, we really did have a great time though."
253,2016-7,Universal was trying to overcharge for express passes! I didn’t like it at all especially when they filled the park to 90 percent capacity unlike Disney that was way less crowded! The park itself was great but too many people!
254,2016-7,"This was our first trip to universal studios and Island of adventures . It was decent, you get spoiled by Disney, so some aspects I was disappointed. For example they sold us the quick service but we couldn’t use it at the universal hotel we stayed at. They didn’t mention that when you were doing the purchase and it was limited as to where you could use it since a lot of places weren’t open in the morning (we got to the park right as they opened at 7) and might as well forget trying to get into the three broomsticks for breakfast. So we basically paid for every meal and gave 8 snacks and 3 meals away before we left there in hopes that they would get used. Also we purchased the photo pass and that was useless as there was only one person at the entrance of both parks. I literally paid to take my own pictures. Possibly 16 pictures all at the entrances and all they did was have my son do different poses and I have 3 pictures that don’t even belong to us. So don’t waste your money. Next time I will check a bag to bring my own snacks and drinks. Since I have never been I am not sure if the lack of available meal places or photographers is due to covid but in that case they need to have that info before you purchase or do like Disney and not offer them due to covid. Other than that, I was very impressed that they were very on top of making sure everyone stayed 6 feet for social distance. I liked that neither park was overwhelming like I feel like Disney is.we did 4 park days and really could have gotten away with 3. 1 park day each first 2 days and the 3rd day just to explore shops and do rides we liked a second time. I also would like to make a suggestion for the app, be more specific about the ride info. If it’s a high speed coaster it should say it in the app. We got ushered (never had to wait in line) right to the seat for the revenge of the mummy. Because I was in front of the line I just lead and didn’t look around. Apparently there was a sign right before you got on the ride that it was high speed but I didn’t see it as the worker walked me right to the seat. My husband saw it but didn’t say “hey I thought you said this was a virtual ride” so with a smaller child, it’s not our type of ride. My son is 13 but is the size of a 9/10 yo so I was afraid he would fall out and it was dark. Haha We were terrified. Lol so I would like to see in the future a better filter for the app. Like filter not only to which park you are in but more of a list view of places to eat or things to ride. All of those small dots are overwhelming and you have to click each and every one just to see which ride or food place it is to eat. Either way we had a great trip and can’t wait to go back."
255,2016-7,"We opted not to purchase the express passes since they cost more than the one day ticket. So we’ve waited more than two hours in multiple lines because the express pass customers get so much priority. On The Hulk rollercoaster, one family rode THREE TIMES while we waited in line. I get that they paid the ridiculous $195 apiece for that express pass, but let’s be reasonable. And this is with restricted capacity due to Covid. Also, we got into the park at 7:20 am (opens at 8) and within minutes there were no more virtual line times for Hagrid’s motorcycle ride, which means even though we were among the first people here, we will not get to ride that today. Needless to say, we’re disappointed with all the wasted time today. Universal can and should do better."
256,2016-7,"I love universal, as they have great food, fun rides and great place to people watch.  Like any amusement park, it is packed but it seems exceptionally longer here than other places. One of the rides - Harry Potter and the escape of the gringotts was 300 minutes wait. Once we got on the ride, it was fun. At the end of the ride, it was stuck and we waited inside of the super tight locked for 20-30 minutes. I was very anxious and had to use the restroom and they didn’t tell us what was happening. Just a prerecorded message that they were delayed. Once it finally came back on and they released the locks, the gave us one ticket each for a fast pass ride of our choice.  The food options are great. Especially the seafood restaurant- Lombards landing. Prepare to wait a bit for food.  Most rides are 3D rides, some interactive, like the men in black. All fun and movie inspired rides. I recommend going once. Come early and stay late to get to experience everything."
257,2016-7,"This was our First time visiting Orlando, Florida (Please get some Comfortable Shoes, a lot of walking and bring plenty of Money, lol). We knew we wanted to go to Universal Studio so we ended up doing the 2 Park, 2 Day Pass (Wednesday, Thursday). We rented our Car from Avis which gave us a free upgrade to ""Prime Parking"" (Parking is $26 a day, Prime Parking is $40). We parked in their very nice huge garages and madr the long walk to the Park. The first Park we visited was Universal Studios Hollywood. The park is overwhelming and every attention to detail was diplayed throughout. The Park was very Clean and everyone was practicing Social Distancing and they had several employees cleaning during the day. There were plenty of Restaurants, Rest Areas and Restrooms located throughout. The only ride that we did not lime was ""The Fast and Furious"". I saw a quote that I am going to use, ""There was nothing Fast about the Attraction and we were Furious we waited that long in line"". All of the other Rides and Attractions were very good. The Harry Potter section seems like a world all by itself.  The next day we visited Island Of Adventures. This Park was very clean and nice also. We did not make it the Jurassic Park area. The Harry Potter on this side is more detailed especially with the Castle. When you get inside both of the parks, you will see why the price of Tickets are like they are. We had kids with us and at times you can't put a price on Adventure, Excitement and pure Fun for the Family. Overall, we enjoyed our time and just outside the Park is Universal City Walk with some good restaurants. We ate at Panda Express one day and the next we at Bubba Gump Shrimp. The overall interaction with the staff and employees were very pleasant from the Parking Booth, to Parking Attendants, Police/Security, employees taking temperatures, ticket takers, cleaning crews, ride attendants, gift shop, and restaurant workers. We will definitely return. Thank you for the Memories!!!"
258,2016-7,"I have NEVER in my entire life, been treated so poorly at a tourist attraction as we were here.  We worked our butts off to get on the virtual line for the Hagrid line, and even had a sweet lady who offered us some of her expired line tickets to get our group in, a group of mostly teenage girls (8 of them).  We waited in line for 1.5 hrs, yes 90 minutes AFTER getting the virtual line. But that’s not the bad part.  After waiting in line for 1.5 hrs, the worker at the front said he had been watching our group the entire time and we would have to leave because the girls hadn’t been wearing their masks OVER their nose.  Let me repeat, they had been WATCHING us, for AN HOUR AND A HALF, and because the TEENAGERS couldn’t keep their mask over their NOSE after 12 HOURS wearing masks in the park, we had to leave the ride.  No warning, no hey, could you please keep your mask above your nose or we’ll have to ask you to leave, no nothing.  I’m sorry but have you EVER been around teenagers who’ve been wearing their mask for 12 hours straight. They NEVER took off their mask and were NEVER disrespectful when people asked them to cover their nose. While they were talking and dancing and playing games in line during the 90 minute wait, it would occasionally slip and they would fix it.  I didn’t realize employees here don’t know how to communicate effectively, or are crazy power hungry that they get pleasure over watching teenagers in line for 1.5 hrs just to kick them off at the front. It’s crazy, I have NEVER experienced anything like it, and I am so disappointed in Universal. I’m in shock honestly of how we were treated and singled out like that.  The very next ride I went on, I saw a group of teenagers doing the exact same thing ahead of me in line, and NOT A WORD from the staff about it.  Disappointed, shocked and honestly hurt over how we were treated. Honestly, a day later the situational is almost laughable at how badly it was handled. Wow. You could’ve handled it so much better Universal, but instead you lost 10 families and their business and respect for you."
259,2016-7,"On a whole, Universal studios and Islands of Adventure are amazing. You should honestly go, it's awesome. What they did with Harry Potter worlds is nothing short of awe inspiring.  However, I am leaving one star review because of simple fact that they allow The Fast and Furious ride to remain open.  We waited 90 minutes to ride what I can only describe as the worst ride in the history of rides. It was so lame that the the queue experience was honestly better than the ride, and that part sucked as well.  It is so bad that all the park employees and staff know the second you mention it they feel a tremendous sense of embarrassment and shame.  Look, we don't expect anyone to be perfect or bat 1000, but it is offensive to park goers to allow them to waste their time to go on this ride. Just admit you made a mistake and close it. It literally does more harm simply keeping it open.  My group spent more time talking about how much we hated that ride than we did talking about how amazing the new Hadgrids $300mm roller coaster was - which is a HUGE feat considering it is one of the top 3 rides I've ever experienced in my life.  How can the same company who has created an incredible and immersive Harry Potter experience where park goes can buy plastic wands that can make stuff happen throughout the park in a truly magical experience allow a ride like Fast and the Furious to remain open.  Universal knows it's terrible and the park goers know it's terrible so just take it behind the barn and put us all out of our misery."
260,2016-7,"Long waits, 2 rides broke after we waited for 30 minutes. Express passes were $300 per person. All in all, total rip-off and huge waste of money. Go to six flags, Busch gardens, carrowinds"
261,2016-7,They won't let you cancel if you have COVID. That policy is stupid. They're only going to encourage sick people to go to the park.
262,2016-7,"They have some great rides; however, all new rides require a “virtual pass” that is booked through the Universal App. The problem is you can wait all day and not get a ticket for the ride...it is a scam! Three days in a row I waited for each release time and click the pass and they are not available, I am talking within 3 seconds! Sad thing is many travel a long distance and want to ride the rides, but cannot! Lots of money, no reward! Plus the new rides do not have Express Pass, so don’t waste your time or money on that either! Will never go back until they do away with The Virtual Pass...hate waiting in lines, but at least you get to ride the rides."
263,2016-7,Traveled with two teens during Spring Break. Stayed at the Royal Pacific Resort onsite therefore we had Unlimited Express Passes. Highly Recommend the Passes! Wait time for most rides were 90-120 minutes. However with the passes we were able to get on a ride in 15 min or so during spring break. There was Social distancing on rides and queues but not in Diagon alley-it was packed. Staff at train station--very organized and friendly. This is our second vacation at this resort highly recommend.
264,2016-7,"We visited Universal with our 3 kids, ages 13, 11 and 9. They all loved it but didn’t love all the 3D and 4D shows/rides. They loved the Mummy and Rock and Ride roller coaster but that was about it. Luckily we had express passes as we stayed at the Hard Rock, so we were able to ride all the rides by noon! The express passes are amazing. Some of the rides had a 120 minute wait and we waited maybe 4 minutes! The longest we waited in line was 15 minutes! We were mad that we didn’t buy the hopper pass to visit Island of Adventure as we would have had plenty of time due to the express passes.  Definitely buy lanyards for your passes. You need to show/scan them on every ride so a lanyard is very handy. Pack light when you visit as some rides don’t allow even a phone! You need to put everything in a locker. Some lockers are free during that ride and others charge you.  If you plan to leave the park and eat at city walk, make reservations! All the restaurants fill up quick and if you don’t have reservations, you most likely will not get in."
265,2016-7,"This is a great theme park. There are a lot of rides however that use 3-D technology, just to give you warning if you get dizzy with 3D effects.  They have added plexiglass dividers in many of their rides.  We recently rose Fast and Furious. It jerked violently at the end so that the two us hit the plexiglass divider and our knees hit the metal row dividers.  We will probably never ride this attraction again. Universal needs to do better in providing restraints."
266,2016-8,This was our first time at Universal and I was not disappointed. They have something for every member of the family.
267,2016-8,I went during March Spring break. The tickets were priced high because they said they were sold out and that it was Spring Break is what they told me. If you purchase your ticket at the gate please keep in mind that no discounts will be honored for a one day visit. It doesn't matter who you are a member of. They push for multi day and multi park specials. There are some attractions that are closed for the kids. Wood Pecker Village was mostly closed. When the rides get really full they make people do the Virtual line experience which is an app you install and reserve a time to ride. You will get a code to use to enter the ride. Express pass cant even get in unless they schedule it. The Mummy Experience was one such ride and difficult to ride because of this. You are not able to eat in some restaurants. Be prepared to wait for 30 mins 1hr for the line and another 1 hr for your food to be ready. I feel they shouldn't be charging more for offering less.
268,2016-8,We got discounted tickets through ID me for being nurses. We went as a girls trip. I wouldn't recommend taking children smaller than 14 because there is a lot of aggressive movement from the rides. This park is not for smaller children. The best part of taking the smaller children is that it has the characters for them to see but it is not really for smaller children. Definitely a great time wait time even with the pandemic was reasonable. They did a great job with keeping it spaced out and accommodating. The tacos in Simpson land are delicious. Harry Potter world definitely is a 2 to 3 hour adventure. I would head their last so you can get your wand which is expensive 50 dollars for something that only works in Harry Potter world if you get the cheaper one which I think is like 47 it is not interactive. Great time all together the Mummy ride was my favorite. BUTTER BEER is amazing. Hand sanitizer is given to everyone who is riding the ride and hand sanitizer is around the park.
269,2016-8,"We are staying on resort for four days. The accommodations are comfortable and convenient. Where things go south are at the theme parks. Poor signage that makes it difficult to navigate the parks. Overcrowded! We were under the impression that the parks were open but with reduced capacity. That did not appear to be the case. Wall to wall people with ride times that were 1-2 hour waits. There was always the option to purchase Express Passes, but due to high demand Universal jacked up the prices for 3 Express passes to $900+. Not that the Mouse is less greedy, but it’s more organized and they still offer limited Fast Passes. We won’t be returning. Moving forward we will stick with the Mouse."
270,2016-8,"They oversell tickets instead of having an organized reservation system. We had tickets, showed up early in the morning, park was at capacity. We stood in a stand by line where staff tried to encourage people to leave. Wanting to get what we paid for we ended up sitting in line for an hour and a half which is rediculous considering what we paid for tickets just to enter the park. Once we got in it was excessive crowds, kids not wearing masks properly. We've recently had Covid and weren't worried about getting it but if you are worried, don't come here. Their lack of organization is awful. Ride technology was not impressive."
271,2016-8,They put to many people in the park to allow social distancing. Especially at the entry we were treated like cattle ith no way to social distance.  As expected the food was over-priced but that is to be expected. I was frustrated that they didn't have enough food outlets to have a reasonable wait to get food. For lunch we had to wait over an hour and a half with a over-hungry seven year old.. Would have given him a snack but bringing in food is against their rules.  R
272,2016-8,"1.5 hours to eat. Do better Universal. Never enough access to food. When you have tired kids it is not good to wait 1.5 hours to eat. When you can eat you get weird crap line roast beefs sandwiches and turkey legs. just make burgers and chicken nuggets easy to purchase. If chick fillet can do it, i think universal can figure it out. Or should be able to figure it out."
273,2016-8,"We recently spent the day at Universal Studios and while it has some neat attractions, features, and rides, I have to give this a ""poor"" rating due mostly to massive crowds they seem to be letting in (during COVID no less) and our inability to see or do much. Our 7 hours at the park only allowed us to 2 rides due moslty to fighting crowds. We were left exhausted and frustrated. For those of you planning a trip let me give you some tips and warnings:  1.) LONG LINES FOR RIDES - GET EXPRESS PASS: If you are coming to ride the rides, you almost certainly will need to buy an Express Pass, which is an additional purchase over the regular ticket cost (our regular one day ticket was $140+tax without the express pass which would have been another $80 or $90). Just bite the bullet and buy them if you want to ride several rides. It will likely take your wait down to 15 minutes give or take to wait for a ride. Otherwise, lines for those without the express pass were VERY long on a Tuesday we were there. Most of the rides had anywhere from 90 minutes to 200-minute wait (Harry Potter) all day with some of the less popular rides dipping down to 35 to 60 minute waits later in the day. only to fill back up to hour-plus waits as people check the Universal app and see the shorter lines. To give you an idea, we rode 2 rides in the 7 hours we were there. Universal had a huge crowd and is selling tons of tickets which leads me to my next point.  2.) SOCIAL DISTANCING: Beware if you're concerned about COVID and want to social distance. I'm not a fanatic about it but Universal's reminders to social distance was a joke. I don't know if Universal has reduced capacity due to COVID but if they have it surely can't be much. Everywhere we went - walking the streets, waiting in lines, standing in shops -- you will bump into people. LOTS of people. It's not enforced because it's impossible. Universal will occasionally make rote announcements telling people to social distance. It was like having a pool party and telling people to get in but try and stay dry. Can't be done unless you stay out. If you don't care about social distancing then this won't be an issue.  3.) MASKS REQUIRED: This is taken pretty seriously. Expect someone to tell you to put your mask on if they see you walking around without one or wearing it around your chin. They were pretty serious about masks for the most part.  4.) FOOD EXPENSIVE AND LONG LINES: I get it, this is a theme park so not a shock. But $52 for 3 hot dogs, 3 bags of chips & three drinks. Crazy. It took someone from our group of 10 about 45 minutes to get 2 tacos with only about 10 people in line. Super slow. My tip is to bring a bottle of water to refill and a few snacks to get you by if you're not interested in spending time waiting in line on expensive very average food. Then save your money and eat somewhere else outside the park.  4.) VIRTUAL LINE: A few rides/experiences have a virtual line you can reserve on the Universal app. A limited number of virtual passes are released every 2 or 3 hours during the day - e.g. 11 a.m., 2 p.m., 4 p.m. -so you have to be on the app when they're released otherwise you're out of luck. The Jimmy Falon NY Experience ride was really great. I wish Universal would increase the use of the virtual line option for more attractions.   5.) ORDERING FOOD ON APP: We ordered three butter beers from Harry Potter land hoping to be able to just pick them up. No luck. We had to wait in line with everyone else for 20 minutes. In other words, pre-ordering the butter beers was a complete waste of time. Universal really needs to figure this out.  6.SOME ATTRACTIONS LOOKING TIRED: Some of the rides could use a refresh. ET and Men in Black, as examples, might be classics but for Universal to stay relevant they should consider changing these over with so many more good movies and pop culture icons to pick from.  Overall, I don't think we would go back anytime soon. We paid $600 for 4 tickets plus another $200 or so for souvenirs, food, and parking. $800 for a day is a lot of money. It's just too much to fight massive crowds and not get much accomplished all while wearing a mask and being told to social distance when it's impossible."
274,2016-8,"Warning! Save your money! Don't book their vacation packages! NEVER purchase travel protection! You will NOT be able to cancel and waste your money.  I recently purchased a vacation package (hotel + tickets + travel protection) via Universal's official website. Purchase and payment via the website were seamless and easy.  But if you have the slighted chance of changing or cancelling the package afterwards, just don't purchase the package and especially not their travel protection (""Cancel for Any Reason"") because you will NOT be able to do so. Other than the purchase, if you want to change or cancel, you MUST do so via the phone and can NOT do so via the website or mobile app.  You will NEVER be able to reach them at the number they give you, though. I tried for days, each time holding the line for over an hour. Today, I'm practically on the phone the whole day. No use.  Problem is, if you don't succeed until the check-in date of your reservation, you will be forfeited the whole purchase amount. Yes! No joke.  So, to sum up. Don't book Universal if there is even the slighted chance your plans may change. Don't purchase travel purchase, because that's another hundred dollars wasted. You may be able to cancel for any reason but NOT at any time because you CANNOT get them to pick up your call."
275,2016-8,"Terrible experience. They obviously don’t care either. The place was absolutely packed. Lines for most rides were 90 minutes and some were over 2 hours thus making it impossible to ride more than 7-8 rides despite being there for almost 11 hours and paying over $600 for 3 tickets.  At 1130 am one vendor had no ice so we were given drinks with no ice. We went to an icee vendor who had no icee’s, an ice cream vendor with no ice cream, only finding out after...waiting in long lines.  The few rides we went on were great but not worth the time or the cost."
276,2016-8,"We went early, 7am to assure we get into the park. Even though tickets are purchased for a certain day, admission is not guaranteed.  All fast passes were sold out. With that said, Harry Potter ride was 140 minutes wait about all day as well as many other rides. We did not ride all rides due to the wait.  My daughter did the woodpecker ride alone and had a stranger sat next to her——-where are the COVID rules there????  Universal is NOT releasing capacity numbers, there is no way this park is functioning with decreased capacity the week of 3/15!!!! Absolutely ridiculous.  Very disappointed with our first ever visit to universal, basically a waste of the $999.52 we spent there!"
277,2016-8,This was my second time going. I spent $280 on 2 tickets and we only got to ride 2 rides. One broke down and the other we wanted to ride had a wait time of like 175 minutes! $40 for parking close. No where to sit while you wait in line.
278,2016-8,"Cast members were rude and could care less about you being there. They seemed really inconvenienced when you asked them anything and they increased the prices for everything just because it was spring break. Harry Potter world was amazing tho. The other parks are really gimmicky and generic. Food and restaurants were really good, but again the staff seemed really inconvenienced."
279,2016-8,"SAVE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR TIME!!! We simply wanted to meet friends on the City Walk for drinks and lunch. What we got was completely harassed every minute by cops and security for dopey mask violations. If they saw you with the mask below your nose, they made a spectacle out of this tiny infraction... Florida is a mask RECOMMENDED state,, but Sick Money grab Disney and Universal make it a capital offense!! Besides,, $100 lunches,, $15 watered down drinks and a ridiculous $26 parking fee is just not worth the hassle!! Take your kids and family anyplace but here... trust me,, you’ll thank me!!! Peace....."
280,2016-8,"If a park sells tickets those tickets should be a reservation for the park instead of a standby ticker one may not even be able to use. It's a scam for the public to make up the lost revenue due to covid shut downs and limited capacity. If one buys a day ticket it is guaranteed access. If one buys a ticket good for 4 days one stands in line on standby. Which may or may not happen. Park has extended hours and one may assume because of extended hours they have increased number of ticket sells as well. We flew from DALLAS, TEXAS with young children to stand in standby line for hours with zero shade. Good thing the restaurants will give you FREE cups of water..... So far that water has cost us the price of 3 adult, 2 children 2 park/4 day passes. Thanks Universal Studios for making our incredibly important spring break a disaster!!! Oh and these tickets are NON REFUNDABLE!! THIS SPRING BREAK WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR OUR FAMILY and so far it's a far bigger disappointment than I can even express adequately here on this review."
281,2016-8,"Had a great time even though it was CROWDED! We stayed on Universal property so we had the Unlimited Express Pass. WORTH it!!! Even though it was spring break and the part was near capacity we never waited more than 30 min for a ride. Most the time we walked right on. Here are a few tips:  1. Virtual tickets - if you select your time and then move the slider to two the tickets are gone. If you select the time and leave it at 1 you'll get them but you have to go on right when it says.... like set an alarm 1 min before and just sit and try and try until it hits that time. You'll get them if you do this. If not, they are gone by 1 min after the time it says. Hagrid's let us on with 2 even though ticket was for 1. They would have left the 2nd seat open anyway for covid procedures. 2. Terrace Falls! Best lunch. Get the chicken rice bowl. We went there twice during our 4 days. Loved it! 3. Citywalk - make reservations days in advance or be prepared to get your food togo and eat on the sidewalk or your room. 4. Harry Potter areas are SO CROWDED from open to about 6pm, that was our fav time to visit them. Let the crowds calm down and then go. 5. DONT waste your time with Fast and Furious. Wow - worst ride ever. I'm so surprised this one is a virtual line. It was terrible. 6. Hagrid - once we figured out the trick I mentioned above we got to ride this one about 3 times a day. 7. Toothsome Chocolate - Food is meh, desserts are great. Go for dessert and skip the food.  Universal staff was very nice. Very pleased with covid procedures. It WAS so nice standing in line and having space between parties. I hope this is the new standard forever! Way less gross smells along the way...haha.  One grip to Universal - WHY are there no rides that are female based?!? Literally, the only one in both parks was some Storm ride that was closed. Please add some!!"
282,2016-8,We love Universal Studios... our children are older and like some of the scarier rides and big graphic props like gorillas.
283,2016-8,One of the biggest waste of money I’ve ever had. I understand covid and all but constantly people were getting yelled at not even nicely all employees are extremely rude. Also got yelled at for drinking a drink cause I didn’t have a mask on cause I was walking and not stationary. Then they make you sanitize your hands at every single ride my daughter is allergic to ethanol and they almost they were not going to get in the rides because she couldn’t sanitize her hands. We will never go back their even after covid is over.
284,2016-8,"I've been to a few theme/amusement parks since the pandemic and UO does it RIGHT. There's an obvious focus on keeping everyone safe but they mange to do it without it feeling cumbersome or overwhelming. I legitimately had a blast 5 days in a row. Of course, UO is also incredibly immersing and I recommend it above all amusement/theme parks (more than Disney of any flavor, Cedar Point, Six Flags, etc.). These are the 2 parks that benchmark my very high standards! Great for families, couples, kids... Im even taking my parents later this year for their 50th wedding anniversary! Truly a place for all and the cleanest and ABSOLUTELY FRIENDLIEST STAFF ever."
285,2016-8,Excellent it was well worth the money. Be careful though. We accidentally entered Adventure Island and meant to enter Universal Studios.
286,2016-8,"I went a total of 3 time during their covid procedures (oct 2020, dec 2020, and jan 2021) everything was clean, well taken care of, and the staff was strict on enforcing the mask mandate and sanitizing your hands before and after every ride which made me feel so much better! I went to both parks every time and the transition was seamless. Lines were spaced out nicely and the way they were placed almost made it go by faster, food was good, the only thing I would recommend is maybe lowering the capacity, although everyone was following the guidelines. Fair reminder the parking is still expensive, but a great trip all around."
287,2016-9,I called to upgrade my tickets. Online they had plenty of tickets but after waiting over 2 hours on hold for customer service they were sold out. Either make it possible to upgrade your tickets online or higher more than 1 customer service person. Waiting for over 2 hours just to talk to someone is unacceptable.
288,2016-9,"A very Negative experience. $600+ For four tickets, plus parking $26 plus $84 for burgers chips and coke, plus more and more and more here and there for literally ONE ride, seeing hours long lines, bad food, walking around decorations, and stuff that costs 1/4 of the price you pay.  Positives. HarryPotter place is beautiful ... and very crowded. ... and our 10 years old daughter was very happy.  Can not recommend the place."
289,2016-9,"We have had Universal passes several times over the last 15 years. We drive from Tampa because it is so much better than Busch Gardens.  Always clean, great staff (with rare exception like the Guest Services supervisor yesterday). Universal is always on the cutting edge of theme park entertainment. The Mardi Gras action and food selection was amazing."
290,2016-9,"We spent full working day in Universal studio. Recommendation is to buy tickets for 2 parks (Universal studio and Island of Adventure) - you’ll surely get full enjoyable experience. Transfer between parks is on Harry Potter Hogwarts express - it’s so interesting! There is a digital performance inside. You can see (spoiler) even dementors...! If it’s working days (Mon-Wed) you can try almost all sideshows (2 parks) at one day. If it’s crowded weekend the best way to try everything is express pass. Harry Potter rides located in two parks and HP experience is really cool among all sideshows. All rides are really thrilling, interesting and high-quality. Everyone will love it! Of course, there is a lot of food and drinks options."
291,2016-9,"I go here every year with my friends. We always get fast passes, so we get to ride everything. It is always an amazing time, but is unbelievably hot and you will sweat a lot. We love going here and will continue to!"
292,2016-9,"We tend to visit this park multiple times, kind of a park hopper if you can relate. We enjoy the rides and the shows here every year at least twice per year."
293,2016-9,"Maybe it’s due to the pandemic but we thought it was fun but lacking in rides and activities. There are only 3 rides in the marvel area, a couple in Jurassic Park, even the world of wizardry left us asking if we missed an area. It is fun. It’s just not as big as the hype."
294,2016-9,Wait for Transformers was 90 min due to covid social distancing. Park tickets are still full price though so you really don't get the the experience you are paying for.
295,2016-9,"(I REALLY hope this doesn't break any rules) Spoilers???  A Subjective Review – Non-private VIP Experience Universal Orlando Resort By Robert Gerber Day 3 of our vacation, 26 Feb 2021 (Friday) My Thoughts: I give this a 5/5. Although we had had 2 days in the parks (Wednesday the 25 was mostly spent at IOA; Thursday the 26 was spent mostly at US) and rode everything we wanted and more, the semi private / non-private experience provided a well paced opportunity to enjoy the park, the rides, and some fun facts. I’ll be walking you through the experience shortly, but let me say – this is not a walking tour as you would through a major city or attraction. One of the big bonuses of this tour, as I’m sure many of you are aware – you will walk on to all rides. There were two individuals on our tour who I must give credit and were super champs and sucked it up. I don’t think they knew what they were getting into. I tried to be supportive as I was them two years ago. They told me they appreciated it – they made it easier to participate. By early afternoon, they ditched the tour. I felt so bad, but I would recommend – read up on what you’re getting into! 😊 I had been told, when you check in in the morning, kindly ask – you want EVERYONE to have fun, but you want to kindly request to be grouped with a like-minded, like aged tour so you all get what you want. I have to say, Universal did an excellent job at doing this. Of the 6 of us who remained, 4 of us rode Rip Ride Rocket and Hulk… the rest of the rides, we all did, and it was so much fun! Oh, and The Fast and the Furious broke down before we could get on – I was not sad haha. How much did this run me for 2 persons? 511USD with Tax. To me, was it worth it after having express passes and annual preferred passes that gave us the 10% discount and unlimited express passes from our stay at royal pacific (which was amazing by the way) and were able to walk on to 99% rides in less than 5 minutes? YES.  Fun Note: Hagrids Motorbike adventure, from someone who HATES roller coasters – is AMAZING. I’m happy to suggest, if you had coasters – watch the youtube POV videos and prepare for the 1 backwards drop (which isn’t bad) and the 1 story drop which has a soft landing and also isn’t bad – god this was amazing. Rode it 5 times in 3 days. Would’ve been more, but it broke down mid-morning on our first day. In the afternoon, when the Queue read 75-90 minute way… we weren’t in queue for longer than 20 minutes FYI! Keep that in mind for during the middle of the week. We were able to end our vacation on Hagrids, run over for butterbeer icecream and a dragonscale brew. What a great ending to a great vacation. I hope you all get to have as magical an experience as my wife and I had.  Now, on to the review…  Non-Private/Semi-Private VIP Experience: 26 FEB 2021  AM: Arrived at the VIP Entry near guest services at USO. They let us in around 8:25AM. I made my request to kindly be paired with a group of the same age, and mindset for coasters. They were funny and polite – and understood. We were escorted to La Bamba for Breakfast. The menu was pretty good. I had the overnight oats, my wife the ham, egg, and cheese. We both had coffee. Obviously it was included in the cost of the tour, but I still tipped out waitress 10$. We sat at a long table with 6 others. We all began chatting and learned most of us had the same thoughts of roller coasters. The only ones excited about Hulk and RRR were my wife, another young lady with her girlfriend (girlfriend was like me), and a pair of younger siblings. The 4th pair (two moms) were not big on rides, but again, were super champs.  The Beginning: Universal Studios - At 9:20 our tour guide Dave introduced himself. Dave has worked there for 10 years and I must say, he rolls with the punches. Very pleasant, very polite, and very knowledgeable. He worked his hardest to make this experience as enjoyable for all of us. We left breakfast and headed over to our first ride, Transformers. Up to this point in our vacation, we had not ridden this, but it was very enjoyable. I forgot I enjoyed it more than Spiderman (we rode on Day 1 of this vacation). 1 of the 2 moms declared after this she was done. I felt bad. Dave was very supportive, and I let the moms know I was like them when I came to universal – scared out of my mind. I tried to be supportive and mentally prepare them for the drops, spins, and scary moments so if they know it’s coming – it’s easier to tolerate. 1 of them sucked it up on most rides. The other sat out 99% of the rides and I felt bad. Not to be selfish though, I came to enjoy myself though! I can lead a horse to water, but I can’t make it drink. Dave continued to walk us through giving us detailed history of the park… and then walked us over to THE MUMMY. 😊 Took a backdoor entrance, and like Transformers, we walked onto this ride. This was my wife and my 4th time on this ride during our vacation. Always fun, and the updates to this ride since its refurbishment are a nice touch! My first time on this coaster, I was cursing my wife out for bringing me with her. Now, I LOVE it. It’s NOT bad as far as coasters go.. and it’s fun. It’s also nice to see Brendan Fraiser finally gets his coffee LOL.  From there, we got some backstory on the New York Skyline, and then walked onto Jimmy Fallon’s Race through New York. We all rode this, I believe. It’s not as exciting as I remembered it, but It used to be my warm up ride (yes, 2 years ago I was that big of a chicken).  From Jimmy fallon, we walked over to Rip Ride Rocket. I’ll just say 4 of the 8 of us rode this, including my brave wife. I sat down, reapplied sunscreen as it was 86 degrees already.. and laughed.  Next up, to accommodate the entire group, was ET. I was game – this was actually a fun ride 😊 Not a thriller, but for 1990 technology, really cool to see. We also learned that Steven Spielberg won’t let this ride go anywhere as he was the significant influence over the construction of this park. When it was destroyed at Universal Studios Hollywood, he was not happy. I won’t ruin what I thought was the coolest part… (but it’s towards the end).  Following ET, we skipped over Simpsons, but I can tell you having done it the day before – it isn’t 3d, but it is a virtual simulation (like Minions, but better)… and it was a lot of fun. Something for all ages, but can cause motion sickness. My wife and I enjoyed it – but would only do once. Anyhow, we headed over to MIB. Again, walked right on… and it was fun. I learned that if you shoot the blue tower at the back of the car in front or across from you, you get points and they spin out. Of course, our car wouldn’t stop spinning. It was fun! This was our 3rd time on this ride during this vacation. 😊  After MIB, we went to Fast and The furious, but conveniently – it broke down. I wasn’t sad. I wasn’t excited to ride it. We left this without riding and went to lunch at Finnegan’s in New York. Great place to eat. My wife and I didn’t want heavy food in our stomach, so we stuck to the salmon (which was delicious!) and the soda bread (complimentary). FYI – lunch is included. Oh and before I forget – Water and Ponchos (only 1) are complimentary/included in your tour.  PM: USO to IOA: Following Lunch, we went over Diagon Alley. We had a bit of a short tour, and some fun information (which is great for potter heads like us, and non potter heads alike). From there… Gringotts!!! Already my wife and I had been on this 7 or 8 times this trip… so this is 8 or 9… I lost count. ALWAYS FUN!!! All but 1 went on 😊 Those who were scared, definitely said this was great. It is a great fun semi-coaster. 1 story drop, 1 story up. Some slow turns/spins, but you’re so immersed in the ride, you don’t notice! Again, we walked on. This is a fun perk. Over to the Hogwarts Express. We didn’t hold up the queue to record ourselves running through platform 9 and ¾ LOL… I felt like such a jerk, but so much fun. Got a video of my wife and I running through, and running back through. From there… backdoor entrance and walked onto the Hogwarts Express to Hogsmeade. EVEN with Express passes… we had to still wait 30 minutes the other days! (NOTE: During the week, the path between the two parks is NOT open except on Weekends!) Once we got into Hogsmeade, we got a quick backstory and tour, put our “luggage” into the lockers and we were off to ride Hagrids, and then Forbidden Journey back to back. I must give huge props to one of the moms – she sucked it up and came on Hagrids. I asked her if she wanted me to prompt her. She said yes…. So I was trying to walk her through it during the ride. She said she appreciated it – but still ended up getting sick. I had a new found respect for her! I honestly tried to help her since she wanted to ride, and experience it. I told Dave, our guide, that I apologize – I’m not trying to step on his toes – I know exactly how she felt and I thought if she did what I’ve done – it would help a lot! He said it was ok and he appreciated it. It helps the tour move along. Well, of course we walked onto Hagrids – AMAZING RIDE AND I WANT TO GO BACK AND RIDE AGAIN – and then straight to Forbidden Journey. Both Amazing Rides!!!! Forbidden Journey, I think my wife and I rode 12 times in 3 days. Lol Always fun! I did get slight motion sickness my last 2 times… I don’t know why. Probably fatigue as it was end of the day those last 2 times. Following forbidden Journey… it was off to Jurassic Park River Adventure. I have bad memories here… I ended up getting pneumonia 2 years ago after riding, getting soaked, shivering in Mythos, and going home and getting SICK for 3 months. Bacterial Pnemonia is NOT fun. Disclaimer: I did NOT get pneumonia from this ride or from Mythos. My explanation is the shivering weakened my immune system as shown in the literature – whatever infiltrate took advantage and took over and BAM! It hit me. Next onto Marvel! The world based on the comics, not the movies lol. We walked onto the Spiderman… Learned some fun facts that you should take the tour to learn… but onto Spiderman – which is always fun, and finally… The Hulk! Of course we were down to 6 the two moms were superchamps and thank you to them for going with the flow of the group! I really appreciate it. Only 4 of 6 of us rode (not me!), but my wife did. I just remember looking up, thinking my wife’s car is next and all I hear is “Ooooooooooooooooh ********” as the Hulk Launched. It was a guy though, and not my wife – but I would’ve thought that be hilarious if it was. I’m really thinking, next time we go down – which I hope is in October or November, I’ll do either Hulk or Rip Ride Rocket… probably RRR since it doesn’t go upside down…. After the tour ended, Dave said goodbye… I gave him a 20% tip for a fun day (100$USD)… and we apologized as my wife and I wanted to end the day on Hagrids, and then a Butter beer ice cream and a dragonscale brew. Our tour went over a bit, which we really appreciated the amazing day – but we made a ran for it. The queue for Hagrids was 75 minutes. We got on to the ride in 20 minutes. 😊 We ran across the way before picking up our bags to get our icecream and beer… grabbed out stuff and spent the last 20 minutes of the park’s opening on the bridge to Jurassic Park looking out to Hogwarts enjoying the last few moments of our vacation.  Summary: All in all – to us, the Non-private VIP Experience was WELL PACED… we got lucky with our group (our group was saying the same). We all made it fun for eachother – and Dave was excellent. He knew his stuff, catered to the liking of the group – and just made it fun. Walking onto 12 rides without rushing like my wife and I rode 17 rides and ran like crazy people the day before and were exhausted Thursday… this was the perfect ending to our much needed vacation. Again, I paid 511 with tax for 2 people, but this cost DOES vary depending on day and time of year, so pay attention. Would I do it again? For this price? Maybe… higher… no – I’ve already done the VIP tour. 😊  I give this experience a 5/5 or 10/10 depending on which scale you prefer! It is definitely a thing you should do at least once if you can afford it or justify it. My biggest tip, kindly request to be with people around the same age and like minded about rides and it would increase the fun factor of your day!  Huge thank you to the group and to Dave for making this an amazing experience!  I hope you all are as blessed as my wife and I were during this trip! Looking forward to the next one! — with Kamila Ferreira Gerber at Universal Orlando Resort."
296,2016-9,"I've been a Passholder for about two years now going on three and I always have a fantastic time going to the parks. Since reopening after the pandemic, I've observed staff trying their absolute best to explain things to guests to keep them informed while directing them and still maintaining a Professional and Courteous atmosphere. Under stressful times and dealing with a good ordeal of new rules and procedures both for the guests and the staff, including masks, I've noticed the staff stepping up to the plate to not only do that but to continue to have upbeat and positive attitudes by and large across both main parks. I've had conversations with various staff at length and each time I could actually hear the smile beneath their mask. I'll continue to promote and speak highly of the parks to others due to this and look forward to many more years to come of being a Passholder!"
297,2016-9,I love the changes in architecture and feel as you move through the park. Each section feels unique. The park is very clean and most of the staff are very friendly.
298,2016-9,Went to both Disney and universal on this trip and I thought there was really no comparison. At Disney there was reduced capacity and staff who enforced the social distancing and mask policies. At universal that was non-existent. Most of the staff are teenagers and you see them so far in between that they have no control over the crowds. I had people on top of me on line without a mask for over an hour coughing away and they never got kicked out. People cutting in lines and cursing at each other on top of the drunk people made it a pretty terrible experience. Glad I made Disney my vacation and universal a side attraction.
299,2016-9,"First time at a big theme park during COVID. Universal has set some incredible protocols and I felt safe in the resort. There’s hand sanitizer everywhere and team members checking the mask mandate all the time. Excellent job, universal!!"
300,2016-9,"We visited Universal/Islands of Adventure February 12,13,14, 2021. This was a busy time with Valentines and President’s Day weekend. Two of those days, the park was at capacity. In order for us to go to the other park, we had to either take the train or the walkway over. You could not leave otherwise you might not be able to get back in.  What I love the most about Universal is, with a paid hopper pass admission, you are permitted to do every attraction that both these parks offer. (Unlike Disney’s Hollywood Studio’s virtual queue disaster) I’ll save that experience for THEIR review.  We haven’t been to Universal since 2012. So much has changed since then. I’ll be honest, I really do miss the classics there., Jaws, Disaster, Back to the Future. I understand the need to update and keep it fresh. The Harry Potter attractions where absolutely AMAZING. They paid attention to every single detail. Incredible! We appreciate the safety measures taken during these Covid times however, the dividers on the Kong ride prevent you from experiencing the full 3-D effect of the attraction. Hopefully in the future they will remove them.  We had a great time at both parks . We were thankful Florida is open for business! When we returned home I went on the Universal Studios Hollywood site to compare the attractions. Surprised to see they were not even open for business yet. Thank you Orlando, Florida.  We paid roughly $1,100. for our tickets (family of 4) These tickets were good for for a 5 day hooper. You definitely get the biggest bang for your buck here. If I had done it all over again, I would’ve paid a little more for the season pass which would allow you to stay on site at a 30% discount. Staying on site at their specific hotels also get you express passes! I will certainly do this next time for sure.  Just a tip for those planning to go. You will appreciate not having to wait in line."
301,2016-9,"We went during COVID and temperature check line BEFORE the line to get through security before the line to get into the park, was an absolute mess. People were cutting in line. There were fights. Just no control. It really put a frown on our face before even getting into the park. Once inside, the lines seem crazy long but that is due to social distancing. They move at a good speed."
302,2016-9,"I (Dad) took my two teenage daughters there in February 2021. Rides were quite impressive, even for an adult. Harry Potter was their primary draw and it was very well done. Most of the guests did a pretty good job with mask compliance, and with staying 6' apart in ride lines. However, out and about, especially in Harry Potter areas it was a packed. So if you are cautious (mask compliance, wash hands often, sanitize often) and in good health, then COVID may be a perk for going to Universal Studios for I have heard that it is always crowded during winter/ spring breaks. If you are not in the best of health or immune compromised, or think you will feel too anxious with the crowds, then you may want to wait until we have a better handle in COVID. Highly recommend Express Pass. It came as part of our hotel package and was well worth it. Lines got to 60- 120 minutes long on the weekends."
303,2016-9,They sent a squad of 6 security and one PD officer to drag us to Guest Services to fix their mistake!
304,2016-9,"Definitively worth the visit. This park is awesome!!!!! Great rides, great food selection and lines move fast."
305,2016-9,"The park is nice, but in February most of the restaurants and rides are closed. Then on top of that the big rides are shut down most of the time due to issues. This was not worth the time and hassle to visit universal studios. Should have gone to disney."
306,2016-9,"This was the first theme park we visited on our Orlando trip. We are a family of 3 with a 4 year old daughter. I had been when I was a kid but that was over 30 years ago and my husband has never been.  When you first walk into the park, there's a huge food court before you have to show your ticket. The restaurants all seemed to stay pretty busy so be prepared to wait a little bit for your food. There are some restaurants on the Universal app with mobile order available although I did not use that part of the app.  During our visit there was a Marti Gras theme so that was cool to see the floats on display and staff dressed up and throwing out beads to adults and kids alike.  Some of the things I wish I knew before going to the park...  1. I would highly recommend purchasing the Express pass in advance. We had no idea what this was. Basically you can buy the Express pass which allows you to go into a separate lane and minimize your wait times. At one point we saw at least 4 groups of Express pass people go before our line moved. It was a little angering. I looked into the purchasing the Express pass but it was too late because they were all sold out.  2. I had no clue what a virtual line was. They way it works is that you use the Universal app to find rides with a virtual line. You click on the virtual line and it gives you a window of about 30 minutes. Pick the window you want and you are ""in line"" virtually so all you do is show up within the window you signed up for. For me, it was about 4pm and I picked a 6:10-6:40 window. We signed up for the Mummy virtual line and was only in the physical line for about 15 minutes. It was so cool!  3. What the heck is child swap? I saw signs for that and finally learned that if you have a kid who isn't tall enough, both parents can stand in line with the kid. Once it's time to get on the ride, one parent goes on the ride while the other parent stays with the kid. Then the parent on the ride will get off and stay with the kid while the other parent rides the ride. It's nice so that the whole family can stay together.  4. I'd recommend having a poncho on hand before entering the park just in case a rain shower passes over during your visit. This happened to us and the rain only lasted about an hour. The rest of the day was beautiful.  5. Use the Universal app to see the wait times for each of the rides. The rides can have long wait times but we stayed until the park closed at 8pm. The lines are much shorter towards the end of the day so we were able to hop on the Mummy Ride and the Transformers Ride before we left. They were so awesome. My husband could not believe how cool they were. My daughter was able to ride Transformers and loved it.  6. Don't forget to bring an external battery charger for your phone. If you do forget, you can buy a fuel cell which is already charged for $30. I was stressed out about running out of juice on my phone later in the day and scaled back on using the app and taking pictures until I was able to get the phone charged up."
307,2016-10,"Unfortunately we wish we would have done something else with our day. Long lines- two hour waits (we didn’t pay extra for express pass) for rides. In 9 hours (and $400 plus for three people) we experienced two “rides”. Loved the Harry Potter area and the butter beer- some rides were “at capacity” and so we were turned away after waiting in line??? Even with long long long lines.  To be successful at Universal and see everything - you need to pay more to get the express tickets.  Rides were socially distant - lots of “hall monitors” who were reminding people about mask wearing at all times. People seen cleaning but without limiting access to the park overall- it just made lines longer and longer with socially distant rides.  At least the weather got better - after it poured with heavy rain that morning- but overall a waste of time and money. I was looking forward to going, it’s unfortunate that it wasn’t a better experience."
308,2016-10,You have to pay to use the lockers. Everything here was a money grab. It was PACKED even during a pandemic. At least some of the rides were fun.
309,2016-10,The Jason Bourne Stuntacular show was AWESOME!!! This is the BEST theme park show we’ve seen ever!!!!!
310,2016-10,"This was the worst trip to universal EVER!!!!!! , i had been going since 2009 but now me,my kids John and Karly (Karly 5,John ,6) and my husband Alex have decied to never return. Let's start at the begning of the day parking was REVOLTING!!!! almost no spaces my Karly started to weep saying we would miss our day there (it mad me angry that this places parking is so bad it made my lovely karlyWAIL) we finally it was a miracle wedid find a parking spot. we walked in side and i am so DISGUSTED with how many people there is DO THEY WANT TO KILL US WITH CORONAVIRUS I GUESS THEY DO UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so on to more of our horrible day we decied to wash our hands before we enter and i had to hold in from PUKING ewwwwww.

We had finally decied on"
311,2016-10,"Expensive, long lines, crowded, people not wearing masks properly, and not paying attention to social distancing with little enforcement from staff. Lunch was poor quality especially for the high cost. Stood in a line for fast and furious for 1 1/2 hours and then the ride got delayed. Another 30 minutes waiting for delay to end and another half hour to finally get on the ride. Hard to to more than a few rides with such long lines. Trying to do virtual lines on the app only worked for one ride. . Go to Disney instead. Sorry Universal but never again."
312,2016-10,"There were to many people there, don't they know this is a pandemic? What happened to limited capacity? If I am going to die going out in public CLOSE THE PUBLIC. Where is the common knowledge. The food was good though so I will be going back."
313,2016-10,I wanted to give kudos to Joe in FirstAid - super kind and helpful - typical of all our experiences at UOR!
314,2016-10,"The staff was friendly & kind. CiyWalk was great and had a lot to offer. Although lines were long, they moved along quickly & efficiently. Cons: Park reached capacity quickly. At the time of our visit Universal counted all people in their motels as well as people that came in the park and may have left. Advice: If Universal continues to count people the same way--Go early to secure your spot then you are able to re-enter in the PM. or--make dining reservations inside Universal and you are allowed in. The seemed to go over and above on COVID protocols. They had hand sanitizer EVERYWHERE and squirted it on you as you entered the rides."
315,2016-10,"We bought tickets for 4 days but due to the pandemia, we were able to do it very quickly because there were little waiting times. The best attractions for us were Hollywood Rip Ride rocket, Transformers, Shrek and The Simpsons. Harry Potter and the escape is super all the things around it but the attractions is not so good"
316,2016-10,"Pretty much every interaction we had with park staff was negative. Rude, sarcastic, impolite mostly:("
317,2016-10,"Very bad how they handled within the pandemic season pass holders. Three months extension during a pandemic is ridiculous. Enjoyed the parks for my kids while I was there, but they ripped me and my family off."
318,2016-10,"Here is what I have to say to Universal studios: You have a couple of nice parks, but you customer service and policies suck at the worst level. I bought our family season pass and then the pandemic hit. Okay, I understand, not their fault. They operantly closed for 3 months and re-opened in June. If you recall, June and July corona was at its peak. We called in September and they told us they were extending our passes until January 13. That would be 3 months more than our original expiry date. So I didn't think much of it until I visited the park in October and realized NO ONE WAS THERE. The hotel we normally stay at (Gaylord Palms) was completely empty. I think out of a thousand rooms, there was probably only 10 families. I could be exaggerating a bit on that!! Nevertheless, we arrived at the park only to realize, one of the park is closed and the 2 that are open have several rides that are closed. After thinking about it some more, here is what I find so lame by how they thought they paid back to loyal season holders; 1. They should have extended to all season holders to 6 months more, not 3. 2. No one in their right mind would have visited the parks until October of 2020. No one was at their parks in June, July, August and September. The capacity was only 25% and they only reached 10% 3. One park is completely closed and still closed. 4. Not all rides in the functional parks are activated, but most (to be fair). 5. Every time I speak to them on the telephone they give you such attitude, as if I'm just a greedy guy looking for handout after paying thousands of dollars for not using their parks during the pandemic. 6. Overall; I enjoyed the parks when they were open prior to pandemic, but during the pandemic, they should have done much more for season pass holders. It wouldn't have hurt them to extend to those who paid for season pass. This way, I would have continued. Such bad business stupidity. Unless they change their ways, you will not see me buying any season tickets to this park again. I really don't recommend buying the season tickets. Sorry"
319,2016-10,"We enjoyed our trip even with the pandemic running around. Crowds were very low and the wait times were ridiculously quick. We were able to make it through every ride as well as some multiple times. The only issue was due to masks creating fog during the rides that required goggles, but you put up with a little to get a lot! Go early, plan well, pay for the park hopper!"
320,2016-10,"I thought Universal Studios was just a ok experience. The park, however, was very clean and it looked beautiful. The park just didn't deliver the rides that I mostly like. I'm a coaster person. I did ride Rip Ride Rocket but I thought the ride experience was just sub par. Hulk and Hagrid's at Islands of Adventure are much better rides. I did like the Transformers area of the park. Themed very well. The 3-D ride there was good, but Spiderman at IoA was better in my opinion. The Men in Black ride was fun, shooting at other peoples vehicles to make them spin. We ate at a sea food place in Universal. I don't know the name of the place but it was very good. Probably the best food I have eaten in Orlando. If I knew the name of the place, I'd rate it 5 stars. Universal isn't a bad park, but it's not great either. That is the reason it earns a 3 star rating. Beware the mask police at Universal."
321,2016-10,3rd and last visit. Nazi like germ control staff .....like being chased down by Harry Potter forbidden ride staff because some of the hand sanitize dripped and “you must rub it in for 30 seconds “. The shop attendant at Honey Dukes was the rudest public shop attendant I have ever seen. Luna outside was pleasant selling the butter beer. Lumbard’s seafood grill was fair but costly. Half the shows are not open but still same prize. Hours shorter but parking is $26. Help in “the unprecedented times” is not coming from Universal that is for sure. So disappointed 😔 although the Hagrid ride was pretty awesome Still this hag is reformed
322,2016-10,"My wife and kids are huge Harry Potter fans and I purchased passes through Perks at Work, We where there for two days and really enjoyed it. The first day we did not purchase the fast pass and it was a long day. Second day I bit the BIG bullet and bought the fast passes. It definitely made the day much more enjoyable and we rode so many more rides. We opted for the single ride option since we wanted to ride as many things as we could. Really enjoyed it. The details given to the Harry Potter world are crazy and all of the Harry Potter rides are so much fun."
323,2016-10,"The best park from Universal, second to none. Go to the Simpsons and Harry Potter Ride, then anything else."
324,2016-10,"There were six in our party for a quick vacation. Our granddaughter is a big Harry Potter fan. We stayed at a partner hotel; there will be a separate review for that.  it was a great day! As soon as the park opened, my granddaughter and her aunt raced to the Wand Ceremony (is that what is is called? I no very little about this). They were first in line. What a production! The rest of the day was just as great. We did some virtual rides, something about Fast & Furious was my favorite.  After that, we took the train ride to Island Adventure. Dr. Seuss, Betty Boop, Popeye, and many other of my favorite characters.  And, of course, we ended the day with drinks at Margaritaville.  We had no issues with any thing that day. Frankly, I enjoyed this park better than that other attraction in Kissimmee."
325,2016-10,"BEWARE Seniors!  We just visited this week and we’re taken advantage of because we were seniors. We parked at Universal Studios and went into the park to visit some attractions like the Blues Brothers show, etc. first of all, we couldn’t find our way around because of the lack of maps. Secondly, we didn’t know that we were walking into the wrong park. There were so many signs, you couldn’t tell where you were going. It’s overwhelming. We ended up in the ride park (Island of Adventure). Well, I get sick in these rides. Our daughter likes Harry Potter so we went there. We didn’t realize that there’s Harry Potter in the other park too. After a few rides, we noticed that we were in the wrong park. There was little compassion at guest services. The supervisor said that they had a 20 minute wrong park policy. We were too long in one park after riding a couple of rides and having lunch. We were basically told tough luck. They could easily fix this problem by signing up for one park. We weren’t told that we were in the wrong park until we went to guest services. So for seniors, beware! While there was little explaining about the two park, they had lots of people trying to sell us the vacation experience aka timeshares. Also, beware of the offer of free money. They actually pestered us. We enjoyed Disney and SeaWorld but were very disappointed in Universal. Forget customer service as they are not helpful (Leslie). I would recommend that seniors pass on Universal."
326,2016-10,Masks and social distancing- ok fine but what they don’t disclose at all is you are required to allow them to squirt unknown and undisclosed ingredients into your hands before every single ride. No opt out allowed. It isn’t optional. You aren’t allowed to use your own either. For people with allergies or concerns about toxic loads in the body this is a nightmare. Offering is fine. Insistence without prior disclosure is a legitimate health nightmare.
327,2016-11,"Many shows are closed. In certain areas of the park (around Harry Potter castle and some others) social distancing is very difficult to maintain. Avoid parks during weekend. Crowds, crowds, almost no social distancing and long wait time. Overall experience is 4/5 given the circumstances. Virtual line is not as useful as similar system at Disney."
328,2016-11,"Enjoyed our visit to Universal. As a thrill seeker who enjoys roller coasters mostly, this was a nice alternative during the pandemic. Enjoyed The Wizarding world of Harry Potter/Daigon Alley area. Had to look for the entrance to Daigon as it's not marked which was cool. The Bourne Stuntacular was a very good show and would advise catching if you have the time. Not very busy during the week which was great and the weather couldn't have been more perfect. One thing I wish a lot of parks would adopt that Universal does is offer lockers for free at the rides instead of making you pay for one. You use your park ticket to rent and retrieve your items from the lockers. You'll have to use these as most attractions won't allow you to have your phone and loose articles."
329,2016-11,"Covid policies have ruined the parks. Rules are barely enforced, restaurants have no idea what's going on. Been to the parks many times. 2021 January is worst experience. Will not go back to parks for many years. Entire family."
330,2016-11,"I did not like the reservation system at Disney until I saw the alternative at Universal studios. During the holidays and probably beyond, Universal was operating at reduced capacity. Universal’s solution to determine who got in was first come, first served. Once capacity was reached, entry was closed which meant that we had to get there well before park opening time or our one day prepaid tickets would be worthless!!  The Good: At each attraction, staff applied hand sanitizer to all guests hands before and after the rides. There were plenty of hand sanitizing stations located around the park. The Leaky Cauldron had good food. The four-D rides such as Escape from Gringotts and transformers were fun. Once in the formally designated queue lines, social distancing was more achievable.  The Bad: Harry Potter World was a non-socially distanced mosh pit in the morning. Richters Burgers was mostly disappointing. The action in the transformers ride made one of our party nauseous with motion sickness.  The Ugly: The area between the security check and the entrance was a disorganized mess with no COVID protocols and two lines mashed together for the two separate park entrances.due to the urgency to get inside the parks before capacity was reached led to some bad crowd behavior. Fortunately we didn’t have to try to get a refund of non refundable tickets because we got in. We entered around 7:30. The park reached capacity at 8:10 AM, ten minutes past the published opening time! If we hadn’t heard that they were letting people enter early, we may not have made it in. The TV new ran stories on the rush to get in the day before we visited and warned people to get there early, which probably helped overwhelm the entry lines.  Clearly Universal was not prepared to handle crowds while trying to limit park capacity. Fortunately nobody in our party has contracted COVID in the subsequent weeks after our visit so we made it through. However we were worried about the potential exposure we faced at Universal."
331,2016-11,"We are Annual Pass holders and love the perks! We decided to enjoy the day at Universal Studios yesterday 1/22/21. The crowds were low, social distancing was followed, cleaning procedures were followed and we felt very safe in the park. Universal is our favorite park to visit! We look forward to returning soon for the Mardi Gras Festivities."
332,2016-11,"During covid there was almost no one at the parks. We got through the entire park and got on everything. No wait more than 5 minutes with the exception of having to schedule a virtual time for the fast and the furious. On every ride they made sure everyone put on hand sanitizer, skipped rows and you only were with your group not with other people. Everything had social distancing. A few things were closed. But we enjoyed not Having the crowds."
333,2016-11,"Kudos to the whole group of employees who walked around holding signs reminding people to wear masks properly, distance properly, and wash hands often. You all made the experience much better by reducing our stress in this reassuring way. Kudos to ride and attraction operators who also paused whatever they were doing to ask people to pull their masks up or keep their masks on during rides. Used to ride coasters more when I was younger, not so much now. 4D and 3D attractions were really good, but sometimes a bit much for me. One in particular was triggering: Jimmy Fallon's Race Through New York. If you've had a bad experience in a car crash I do not recommend it. The ""crashes"" feel like bumper cars, but it was still a bit much for me. Thankfully there was hot butterbeer to look forward to. :)"
334,2016-11,"We were there on 2 busy weekend days so obviously there were waiting lines at most attractions. Stil would recommend going to this theme park ANYTIME. You can spend the entire day here! attractions were awesome. Just not for the smallest/youngest kids, say till they are 10 years old."
335,2016-11,"I remember going to Universal in LA way back in 1993 and being blown away by the Back to the Future ride and even E.T! There was a tour of the movie sets with Psycho, Earthquake, King Kong, Jaws and Moses Red Sea being on the tour. It was unique and interesting.  But poor E.T hasn't aged well and probably needs to go home permanently. The Men In Black too was easy to forget. Jurassic Park also dated. These are films from a long time ago and Universal really needs to get with the times.  Plenty of food places and shops around. Easy to navigate. But other than Potter and the dated movie rides the rest is typical theme park fodder, when maybe its appeal was once in its uniqueness.  Potter steals the show, it's not great, but it is very good. If I was between 8 and 12, it would be unforgettable. It needs expanding and focusing on because this is unique to Universal."
336,2016-11,"First off, we haven’t visited here in 7-8 yrs, so we weren’t quite sure what was left from before. We knew Jaws and King Kong had been gone for quite some time(though we don’t like it): But we didn’t know Twister, and Terminator 2 were gone as well. Now the park feels a bit bare. There are a few oldies, ET, and Men n Black, but from there it’s slim pickings. Positives here include the entire Harry Potter area, including the ride, Escape from Gringotts, and Transformers, and maybe the Hollywood Rip Ride Rocket,and Insert crickets here____! Seriously, we can not find anything else worth noting. Maybe jaws wasn’t the greatest ride universal ever had(well, actually it was), but it gave substance to that huge lake area that now feels like a big nothing, you have to walk around, to get to something. So, what’s the purpose of keeping this area, complete with a shark hanging on the dock, hanging around? Also, T2 was a at least a show/attraction that seemed to always be worth sitting through: but it’s now gone as well. And twister, which hadn’t been there that long, is gone too. This attraction was at least worth a look at as well. Now, there’s Shrek, which is terrible, and some jimmy fallon ride through Hollywood attraction, which couldn’t end quick enough. The menion mayhem was ok, but not great. And our 90 min wait for Fast n Furious, ended with the ride breaking down just before we got our chance, so.... The Escape from Gringotts was an excellent ride. The attention to detail is amazing. And though I’m not the Harry Potter fanatic, this area of the park looks realistic from the bits of the movies I’ve seen. Transformers is a well thought out attraction too, though it can make one a little motion sick if you’re not used to it. And the Rip Rocket is an ok coaster, but not as exhilarating as others we’ve ridden. Overall, we feel this is now the weaker of the 2 parks. And don’t try doing both in one day, as you’ll end up running through, trying to get from attraction to attraction, and falling short. And though the express train is a neat way to connect the park, it isn’t worth the added cost. All n all, I’d skip this park, and either spend a full day at Islands of Adventure; or head 10 miles SW to, well, you know where... sorry."
337,2016-11,"I just returned from a fun-filled weekend with my daughter to Orlando, Florida. I'm 100% impressed with all the safety practices they have put in place.  Everyone wears masks (and designated workers are there to remind the occasional person who slips it off). Everything is sanitized. Everyone gets hand sanitizer before getting on a ride and stations are available after the ride. Safety shields are put between ride rows or they go every other row. Everyone is standing at least 6 feet apart in every line. Everyone's temperature is screened.  I highly recommend going to Universal and Island of Adventure. They put safety first and made our experience safe and fun."
338,2016-11,"As an Orlando resident, I have to say that Universal Studios Orlando is my absolute favorite theme park!  I will disclose that my wife works here, however I have loved this theme park well before I even met her. UO is the perfect park for any movie lover. While marquis attractions have gone away and new one taken their place, the experience is top notch from start to finish.  The rides are great, always improving and finding ways to add new value to your experience. However, you have not experienced Halloween until you've gone to Halloween Horror Nights. It is always voted as one of the top Halloween events across the country ever year and for good reason. The attention to detail, the house mazes and the entire environment will leave you wanting to come back year after year.  Other amazing events they put on is Mardi Gras (my other personal favorite), Rock the Universe (so much fun for those who are religious) and Grinchmas (my wife's favorite).  Definitely make plans to stop by on your next trip!"
339,2016-11,"There is so much to do at this park - from the regular ""old school"" rides to the newer 3-D and 4-D rides, there seems to be a little something for everyone. Diagon Alley is absolutely amazing. Even people who don't know much about the books/movies should be impressed. Those who are familiar with the stories will definitely appreciate the detail that went into this park!"
340,2016-11,"Very disappointed. Every attraction had lines that were a minimum of a 1hr wait. Most were longer. Virtual lines are a joke virtual never available. If it wasn't a hour or longer line or a virtual line with no available it was at capacity!!! Ridiculous. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME until the virus is gone! Life is too short for this type of vacation, it was not enjoyable standing in line."
341,2016-11,"We love going to Universal and we really appreciate the precautions being taken during this pandemic. They are really awesome at making sure people are wearing masks and sanitizing their hands to keep everyone safe. There are floor markers in all of the queues to make sure people stand 6 feet apart, unfortunately not all guests follow these markers and we often had people standing on top of us in line. Thankfully anytime we pointed this out to a staff member they quickly asked the people to move away from us. The staff here is great. We had an issue where we lost our Freestyle Souvenir cup on one of the rides. While retracing our steps we came across Emily at the Woody Woodpecker coaster and she was truly amazing. She checked the ride for us and when they couldn't find it she gave us great advice on what to do next. We ended up going to the nearest Food Expo where Esthere helped us get a brand new cup to replace it for free. They were both awesome and turned a bad situation in a great one for us."
342,2016-11,The parks were clean and employees are obviously trying to make it safe for people to enjoy during a pandemic. Lots of sanitizing taking place. Staff was exceedingly friendly and helpful. Easy to get around the park. Crowds were low and we had fast passes so we hopped on every ride. Food options were great. My kids loved eating in the Simpsons restaurant- there was lots of options there. Can’t wait to go back!
343,2016-11,"I want to start by saying under normal circumstances we love Universal however it was a mistake to come during Covid. You cannot even scratch your nose for 2 sec without someone yelling at you to put your mask back on and yes I mean yelling at you they are not nice about it in the least. No one said please or thank you. They were constantly playing a recording of a reminder to wear mask and practice social distancing and the voice was that of some super strict school marm. It felt like we were in a dictatorship country were you are constantly being watched and ordered around. You could visibly tell staff was stressed and unhappy they shuffled people through like hearing cattle. There were a few exceptions to this where staff were actually friendly and acknowledged the stressful atmosphere, however this was the exception. Because I have a smart watch I tried to not bring my phone into the park since they are not allowed on some rides and I didn't want to deal with lockers, however they will not let you order food at many restaurants in the park without using the app. I went knowing things would be different and I didn't have high expectations however I guess I didn't lower them enough because I did still want to have fun and enjoy myself and it definitely did not happen."
344,2016-11,"Family took trip to Florida we spent a day at universal Studios, park is lot of fun. We had a good time. Our group had one person with a disability they were very accommodating. Their was still a lot he could not do as an amputee. But the park did help accommodate him. We got the park hopper I do not recommend it during the winter season parks close early so you do not have time to enjoy both like you can in summer. Staff was much more friendly than their sister park."
345,2016-11,"We bought tickets for both parks, the shuttle brought us from universal Cabana bay hotel.  First trip over we walked to get voodoo donuts. The security guard would not let us in because our daughter had a shirt that had a tiny bad word on it you could hardly read unless you were focused on looking at her breasts. They would not let us turn it inside out, made us walk back to the hotel to change. When we went back into the park, music was playing with cuss words...so much for free speech. Shopped at a few stores, more profanity on shirts....i guess it’s ok to buy the stuff inside the park but don’t wear any into the park...makes total sense.  We arrived early to the park the second day and started riding the rides. Lines were not long and it was easy to get onto rides. The bathrooms were filthy and smelled. Workers were not friendly. Very rude and I never heard anyone say please or thank you. We were told thousands of times to pull our masks over our nose although my mask was stretched out from the rides it would not stay in place. Social distancing was good. Rides were fun. Lots of stuff was closed. Food that was open was gross and way overpriced. Most workers seemed to not speak much English. Not worth $700 for 4 people."
346,2016-11,"My family of 4 (parents with 15 yo and 9 yo) visited Universal Orlando (Universal Studios?)the week of Dec. 27, 2020. When we heard about the capacity limits, we were a bit concerned as they were NOT taking reservations to ensure entry like the other parks. However, we made a point to get up early each day and we got into the parks each time. Once in, they did a nice job of making people wear masks, giving hand sanitizer before each ride and marking 6 ft increments for standing in lines. Even though there were capacity limits (exactly what, they won't say) we thought the park seemed very busy and lines were long. We waited an average of 50 minutes for most rides, but posted times were usually twice what we actually waited. We did not pay for express lines but could see where it would be a smart purchase.... Food lines were also very long around lunch time so we ended up eating in City Walk. My family enjoyed all the rides like the Hulk, Spiderman, The Mummy, Rip Ride Rocket, Escape from Gringotts and more. The whole Harry Potter area was very busy, but that's what's popular! One thing I wish I had known: absolutely NO items can be in your pockets for the Rip Ride Rocket. This whole ride cue was crazy each of the 3 times we rode. The line was confusing, people shouting about lockers, some warning people about the No items in your pockets, people turning back.... I was really ticked off until we figured it out. Anyway, considered yourself warned!! Otherwise, fun day!"
347,2016-12,"Our experience was amazing through and through. We stayed at Royal Pacific Resort and either took the walking trail or water taxi to get in/out of the park. They did a great job at making sure masks were on and handing out sanitizer before every ride. I specifically want to give a shout-out to Brenda who was working at the Pteradon Flyers ride. She went above and beyond to make sure both me and my husband got to switch and ride with our daughter while making sure we didn’t wait too long. Also, Pat in Harry Potter world (Diagon Alley) was fun! She did a special little ceremony with an invisible trophy after challenging me to name all the gargoyles on a certain triangular shaped building. Thanks for an amazing time!"
348,2016-12,"For anyone thinking that the park is going to be less crowded or you will be able to go on more rides, this is not the case. The park is extremely crowded in certain areas and almost all wait times were over an hour and some close to 2 hours. We have been here before and we actually were even close to being able to ride on as many rides as we did last time we were there. We have a child with a disability and the disability pass did not help at all."
349,2016-12,"For a family of 4 at over $550 admission, you can find many others activities to do that you’ll enjoy more. We got there early at 8am and parked in premium (which is worth the $5 extra). All of the checkin part was easy. They take your temperature and have social distancing signs everywhere (although most people don’t pay attention.) The girls really enjoyed the Harry Potter area and we spent more money in there for lunch and accessories. The Mummy and roller coaster were closed. The fast and furious was a 2 hour wait. Some other attractions were shorter waits, but going on 4 or 5 attractions all before noon left nothing left to do the rest of the day with so many events closed. I would recommend a lower admission ticket price during this time since so many things closed ."
350,2016-12,I had a lot of fun I liked how they were taking precautions it’s masks the whole time and from what I could see the lines were very long but me and my family had fast passes the only thing I didn’t enjoy was the shortened hours
351,2016-12,"We visited the theme park on a Friday, and really enjoyed it. The wait times were minimal. We did arrive to the park before 9, but the gates opened at 9. We rode most of the rides before lunch. We also enjoyed the new crape place as well as butter bear. We ate lunch at Mels Dinner and the price was good for all the food we got. You did have to use hand sanitizer before every ride, but I completely understand that they are taking precautions to help keep the park open and safe. Definetly reccommend going in January."
352,2016-12,My first time here but we were not visiting the parks - we had reservations at the toothsome chocolate restaurant. I didn’t know city walk had the same entrance and parking as the parks. Parking was $26. The Parks were full but there were a lot of folks around the city walk shops and restaurants.
353,2016-12,This universal park is in need of some updating and some more attractions. Most of the rides on this side are virtual reality. Jimmy Fallon ride is fun and MIB is cute. The Wizarding World area and the Hogwarts express are the best parts of this park for sure.
354,2016-12,"Orwellian signs everywhere to comply or be removed, staff constantly nagging about masks. If I had taken it down for a second to get a breath of fresh air in the Florida heat, I was immediately yelled at. Staff was also incredibly rude. My boyfriend and I were the only ones in a cart on of the rides so we pulled our masks down, the music of the ride stopped and we were called over the loud speaker by employees to keep our masks on, despite the fact that there was no one else riding with us. Ordering food on the app was not very convenient considering there were a lot of people on the server. Not sure why it's not safe to place an order with an actual person? When getting off the Hulk, the employees announced the ride was closed because the area was at capacity when the line was actually much shorter and less crowded than when my group was in line. Volcano Bay this past summer is much more lax with masks considering it is a water park, which begs the question: why it's safe to not wear masks there and not in the other theme parks? Drop the act. Why they're so strict for a virus that has 99.9% survival rate is beyond me. Will not go back again until things go back to normal, if ever."
355,2016-12,"Had a really great time. I've really missed this place. Safety protocols were in place for the party-pooping Karens and Kevins out there who are still afraid of breathing fresh air but thank God they were not overbearing, just kind reminders without ruining the experience even though I am more than tired of the hysteria. Surprisingly it was crowded more than usual during this time last year. I see it as a good thing as it means people are ready to get on with their lives and get back to having some real fun. You have got to get in early due to capacity limits. Thank you, Universal for showing us a good time and not being a bunch of overbearing nannies. Don't listen to the bitter haters claiming Disney World is better and attacking you on ""safety"" measures. Disney World is beyond terrible. The staff here was great!"
356,2016-12,The house band at the HR is awesome! Abby Road sounded great. Social distancing was not a problem. Best NYE in years!
357,2016-12,"This was our 3rd visit to Universal in 5 years. We have 3 teenagers and 2 toddlers, and it is one of the few places we can go that all of us enjoy - including the adults! We stay onsite for early admission and to walk to the park. We also do Express Pass - well worth it. We also spent 1 day at Magic Kingdom this trip so had a direct comparison and Universal is better for us. More beautiful grounds, they kept more open during COVID (they had characters and parade, Disney had none). Harry Potter world is amazing - just spectacular detail. Hagrid ride is the best coaster ever."
358,2016-12,"We absolutely love Universal Orlando and come all the way from Washington state to visit. We always stay at a Loews property to get early admission and express passes - that is really the best way to go! We have stayed at Royal Pacific, the Hard Rock, and now Portofino Bay. No walk from a hotel to the parks is more than 20 mins tops - so we usually walk but have also used the boats. Boats are slower to board but you've already gotten through security and temperature checks making it sometimes a better option. The parks (Universal and Islands) are packed. I asked someone about capacity and they said it is reduced but with restaurants closed and social distancing on the rides more people are out in the main walking areas. Well, that was for sure - some areas were very crowded! But anyone saying people weren't wearing masks was somewhere else - or maybe talking about the rest areas they have where you don't have to be masked but needed to be 6 ft apart? We were there for 5 days and never saw anyone not wearing a mask. In fact, when someone (inevitably) had it below his/her nose, they were told to fix that. Some people didn't want to observe the stickers on the ground (at the rides) but usually a good long stare at them and then at the sticker would make them be more mindful. If you don't have an express pass - not sure you want to be there when the park is full. Most rides had lines of 2-3 HOURS, but with express pass you pretty much walk right up. If you are at Islands and want to ride Hagrids - you have to get a virtual pass. If you try to go at 7am and just get in line you could wait 60-90 mins. But with a virtual pass we only waited 30 mins even on the busiest days. We rode the ride 4 times and it was A BLAST. Our girls are 12 and 13 and they love Universal. Yes, it is crowded, yes it is expensive, but the HP parts of the parks are magical. This was our 4th trip and it was a blast."
359,2016-12,"If you want to walk around all day and not ride any rides, this is the place to go!! Such a waste of money and time!! We bought our tickets in SEPTEMBER for a trip in December. On the first day, we get there around 7:50am, people are pushing and running to get to the gate. Cutting in lines (apparently they know whats about to go down). We get in the park, it was nice - stood in line for about two hours for Rip Ride Rocket (we were the first maybe 20 people in line for the ride, the ride didnt start until 9:45), Within 30 minutes of standing there the line was already at capacity and was a 3 hour wait. WTF!? We walk around, all while being on the useless Universal App, trying to find a line that didnt have 400 minute wait time. We tried the virtual queues, but those are worthless. We did manage to get on The Mummy ride around 1pm (our second ride of the day). The park has already reached capacity at 9:10am - that should have been a clue for us. We rode our 3rd ride due to the nicest employee, Alexandra. We talked with her for a bit and voiced concerns about the park (why are there so many people here, is universal over selling tickets -, she asked if there was anything she could do and we said ""could you get us on a ride, any ride?! She said OF COURSE! So we headed to Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts - THANK THE BABY JESUS Alexandra was there or we would have never got on the ride - it was at capacity all day. We were at the park for 14 hours and rode 9 rides. We purchased 2 Day Park to Park tickets and was unable to go to the second park because of capacity. We couldn't even make it to the park the second day because it had already reached capacity at 8:03am. It was a f**^ing joke and not the Universal Studios I remember from the early 2000's. One last note - we were going to purchase the Unlimited Fast Pass but at $320 a ticket ON TOP OF the ticket we already purchased to get in the park, was a rip off!! PRICE GAUGING !!!!!!!!!! WE PAID AROUND $1800 TO GET INTO THE PARK FOR TWO DAYS AND UNIVERSAL WANTED ANOTHER $1900 FOR FAST PASSES FOR ONE DAY - ABSOLUTELY ASININE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This park is operating over capacity!!!! Covid or not!!"
360,2016-12,Really disappointed. They only have six rides per park and all rides are 2+ hour waits. The Harry Potter wands and costumes are a ripoff. Universal charges $150.00+ USD and you can get the exact same ones from Amazon for $29.99. The food is insanely priced as well. The park is also so full you can’t walk 6ft apart. They also charge for parking Separately. I would never visit Universal studios again total scam
361,2016-12,"I personally haven’t been to this park in a while, I recall back to the future and ET as the primary rides that used to be there, they’ve now put in CGI movie rides that replace the better rides, (in my opinion) And they all or just motion rides tilting you from side to side and front and back with a little bit of spritzer of water. Nothing to me really exciting except for the rip rockin roller coaster in which I had ridden twice. The crowds were rather full, as for the Covid policies that were required, many people wearing masks, however not really sticking to the 6 foot rule. Very crowded. Guest services were good, accommodating."
362,2016-12,"We arrived in Orlando collected our bags and headed to the universal desk to sign in for shuttle service the the Cabana Bay Resort. We waited 20 mins before the shuttle arrived then rode around in the worn out van for 93 minutes before arriving at our hotel. Complete inefficiency on the part of the driver and whomever schedules the stops. Bad first impression. That sums up issue #1.  We purchased everything we were offered as far as Express Passes and Early entry to the parks. On day 2 of our trip we planned to enter the park at 7. Once we arrived it was obviously PACKED. Super LONG lines. We had no idea where to go and had a hard time finding an attendant to assist us. Once we did, we were told no one is getting in even with an early admission pass. ""back of the line please Sir"". So we waited. Day 3 same thing. I approached another attendant and explained we paid for early entry and were in line with people who had not yet purchased tickets. ""Back of the line Sir"". Later that night I called Universal Customer Service and explained our issue. The lady told me that the park had totally screwed up. She advised that on the next day we don't take no for an answer as she could see what we had purchased and it was everything that could be purchased. Day 4 and 5 we had to shove and push our way to the front and demand the person at the gate investigate our tickets closer. After that we were in. Took a few days to learn the ropes but once inside the park we found the Express Pass worked well and we are glad we purchased them. Early entry is another story."
363,2016-12,"We went last week in December and as usual, very busy. We heard they were going to be like 40% capacity, NO WAY! They were even more busy than this time last year. I was shocked. After going to Disney and seeing how safe they were, Universal was completely the opposite. No social distancing. They didn't care if people were walking around without a mask. We waited 1 hour and 45 min in the guest services line. We waited 5 at Disney. Universal needs to get their self together. I don't think we will be back for awhile after what we experienced this time, and we go every year. Shame on you, Universal!"
364,2016-12,This park was over crowded and you can’t even get on rides! You have to be at the park before 7:30 in order to get in. One day we were not able to get into the park. Not sure what this place is doing but it’s a COVID super spreader!! SeaWorld is a better park and not crowded at all. We were not disappointed. Disney was being too as they did reservations and we were got in the park. Not crowded and had the most fun!!
365,2016-12,"I was vert impressed with the precautionary measures taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Being a pass holder ive been to the park countless times. They had tapes on the floor indicating where each party should stand; at least 6 feet away from the other party...people were spaced out and in some cases there were plexiglass separating people. To protect people each person was given sanitizer right right before getting on the ride. they had sanitizer stations all over the park ... they had a lot of people holding signs reminding you to wear your mask ... you cannot walk around while eating or drinking...you can only be stationary when actually eating or drinking... your mask must cover your nose or your mouth... I observe them reminding people from time to time. If you haven’t seen the Bourne Stuntacular, you should go see it ...my only problem with that, was the social distancing with a little off... they were social distancing along the rows ...people sitting next to you with 3 seats between parties... but there were other people sitting right in front of you and right behind you which doesn’t make sense... in all it was a great experience and I’m glad I took my family to there."
366,2016-12,"Not consistent with covid safety on days with large crowds hit or miss temp checks sanitizer. Not able to maintain 6feet walking through park or existing rides on peak or capacity days due to crowds they need to rethink their numbers for capacity to allow for this. On days with light crowd covid safety maintained constant. Passholder days made for higher capacity even with unlimited express ride time waits were as 2hrs or more. Days without PASSHOLDER or high capacity ride wait were less than 30min w express pass. I believe if they had opened Volcano Bay it might have helped w crowds bc some hotel guest might have opted to go there instead of fight crowds w PASSHOLDER at other parks. Was treated like second class citizen using Universal dining plan waite staff acted like I was an inconvenience can't use dining plan.with mobile app most restaurants wanted you to use that. Also dining plan hard needs a virtual way for patron to check what is left on cards keeping up with multiple recipiets for multiple cards is difficult. Needs a transportation system from back of park to front like Disneyland train so if your at back of park and exhausted or kids exhausted can ride to front of park to exit. Leaky cauldron,three broomstick, margaritville gave best service even with Universal dining was treated w respect and kindness. Rides w virtual lines impossible to get passes for never got one for Jimmy fallon or revengeof mummy. Only got one pass in 14days Hagrid motorbike. Only able to ride Hagrid motorbike with hotel early admission."
367,2016-12,"Had a 1 day visit during Christmas week. Be PREPARED for multiple checkpoints and poor directions/signage (which is bad both outside the park and inside as well). Few signs to help find your way around and what few they do have the font is small and hard to spot. After allowing multiple people to PAY for parking these same people were TURNED AWAY at the park entrance if they didn’t have a DATED ticket for the day they visited the park because the parks were at capacity. We were fortunate enough to have a dated ticket and allowed admission, but I felt badly for those people who had already parked and made the long trek to the gate only to be turned away. Was some of it OVERSIGHT and POOR PLANNING by the visitors...YES, but Universal personnel could have done a much better job of screening and informing at the entrance to parking. I don’t know if these people were given a refund."
368,2017-1,Bourne show is the most fascinating to me. I enjoyed the amazing work they did for the show. The stunt and special effects blow my mind.
369,2017-1,This place so awesome. I recommend getting the flash pass b/c the lines and wait time will be forever. We were able to ride several rides w/ the pass for Both parks and it was great but get the App for all rides wait times. All people wore mask and were 6 feet apart when in line so we felt safe during pandemic. We took advantage of the after hours Harry Potter Tour and it was well worth it to go on a Private tour of the park. The place is clean and people respected the Mask policy.
370,2017-1,"Staff is very rude and not very ""disney like"". One employee pushed my finger away as I was trying to show her something and another was telling people sarcastically to ""use your ears"" when she was giving instructions. There are only 2 good rides and the tickets are sold as a package, come to find out we can only get into one park (universal or adventure island). Wouldn't recommend this park."
371,2017-1,"Super over crowded! I was there on 12/29/20 along with thousands of other people. To improve my and your experience, Universal Studios should more strictly limit ticket availability when we buy our tickets online rather than limiting attraction capacity once you are in the park. I had one day to go to Universal so had I known it would be nearly impossible for me to get into any of the major attractions with less than a 2.5-3.0 hour wait in line, I wouldn't have bought a ticket. I was so frustrated by noon, that I found the Guest Services office and waited in line for 1.5 hours to request a refund, which Universal did grant, and allowed me to stay in the park the rest of the day. Universal Studios has a lot to offer, but it needs to manage its capacity better and enforce social distancing, like Disney does so well, to reduce COVID-19 transmission."
372,2017-1,"Beautiful and clean park, it's just very very busy when you're there the last week of the year. Long lines for rides, foods and restrooms. Wouldn't come back at this time of year again."
373,2017-1,"The only way to do Universal is with the Express Pass! It hit capacity every day of our trip by 9am. Some rides, we waited 10 minutes, some we waited 30 minutes. THE MOST difficult ride to get on is Hagrid’s Motorbike Adventure. This ride doesn’t take Express Pass. We tried the Virtual Line and were never successful until after 7pm! One day, guest services helped put us on the ride because it was our last day. We made dinner reservations 24 hours in advance. We felt that we did not need a dining plan. We did the breakfast at The Leaky Cauldron and food was decent. There is minimal service there due to Covid. During our trip, we also went to Epcot one day (we had never been), and Universal has managed the whole Covid thing WAY better than Disney. Lines were long there 90-120 minutes waiting time for rides and NO fast passes!"
374,2017-1,"Don’t go right now. We visited 12/31/20 with the hopes they were following COVID protocols similar to Disney. They were not! Wall-to-wall people! No ability to social distance at all. The ride ques were ok, but the park was more crowded than I’ve ever experienced it before. There were rides we were never even able to get on because some of the lines were up to 3 hours or closed because they “reached capacity.” If I could somehow get my money back I totally would. What a waste! We should’ve spent an extra day at Disney instead. Disney is doing things well in the parks!"
375,2017-1,Spent a few days here with my 15 year old twins. The only complaint they had was sore feet from going all day long. Theres no shortage of things to do here. Tip: Stay on the resort property and get express passes. Makes life a lot easier. Enjoy
376,2017-1,"My family interrupted our Disney vacation to spend the day at Universal Islands of Adventure. First of all, the ticket prices were exorbitant and after spending the day there, totally not worth the price of admission. Arriving around 8:20, parks were already “at capacity”. Upon admission to the park I’m not sure what their capacity is because it seemed much more than 30-35%. People were shoulder to shoulder. Little to no social distancing. People not wearing masks properly. Many people in lines and walking around with masks down on chins, eating and drinking food while in lines and walking around. Staff not doing anything to correct violations. All virtual queues were filled throughout the day. The only positive was that queues moved faster than the wait times listed but still waited a minimum of one hour or more for each ride. My family and I felt so incredibly uncomfortable the entire day and didn’t leave because we spent over $500 for one day tickets. I am so regretful that I didn’t read reviews prior to going and pray my family doesn’t get COVID after this experience. The two prior days we spent at Disney and it was a polar opposite experience. Disney clearly values its patrons’ health, safety and overall customer experience so much more than Universal. Bottom line, I don’t recommend going to Universal if you value your health and wallet!!!!! I would give zero stars if I could. Universal executives- maybe you should spend a day at Disney to get a lesson how things should be run!!!!! You should be ashamed of stealing people’s money for the experience you’re delivering."
377,2017-1,"In the hopes that Universal was heeding advice from the CDC much like Disney properties were, we visited Universal after Christmas. The parks were both filled fuller than I’ve ever seen them filled and social distancing was a joke. It just wasn’t even possible to socially distance in the thoroughfares. The “virtual line” system was a failure as spots were released four times a day and at those times each day, the app platform was frequently overloaded and non functional. The order ahead option for food was also a joke- great that you get to order ahead on an app- but it fails when universal execs don’t staff food centers to handle those app orders- wait times were crazy and staff were obviously overworked. The whole experience was awful- but hey- at least universal is making bank during covid"
378,2017-1,"The good. Almost all rides and shows were open and operational. The food at the table service restaurants in the parks is EXCELLENT. Holiday hours kept the parks open till 10pm. They did extend one of our tickets to a later date due to park capacity.  The bad. Universal Studios does not have an advanced reservation system for park entry. This is odd considering the fact that many smaller amusement parks do have this. Basically, this results in a mad rush in the morning in attempt to gain entry to the park before it reaches capacity. We went for four days. The park opened at 8AM. One day we arrived at 10AM and were denied entry due to park capacity. This left us with nothing to do on one day of our vacation. Although they did give us a replacement ticket for a later date, the process for obtaining it was cumbersome. First, I attempted to call guest services where I waited on hold for 40 minutes with no one answering, then we waited in line at guest services for an hour before a representative saw us and give us the ticket. When we were given the replacement ticket, no one could print out a confirmation of this for my records. We were told it’s “stored in their system” and that I could call their 1-800 number to get a confirmation emailed to me. When I called the number, the first agent gave me inaccurate info and I had to call back. After being on the phone for half an hour on the second call, I was finally able to get someone to generate an email and send it to me. Regarding covid… We aren’t particularly scared of covid, but if you are, you should know that the park was packed. Lines for rides were regularly 2+ hr wait. Although they did have markers in the lines for social distancing, it was rare to be six feet away from other guests. In fact, we were often shoulder to shoulder with other guests whether we wanted to be or not. The line for food was an hour or more at the majority of dining locations during much of the day. Probably my biggest concern was around the behavior of some staff members. They require you to use hand sanitizer at every ride. At one ride, a staff member accused me of not taking it, then proceeded to get in an argument with me and call me a liar in front of an entire line of guests. Overall, I would probably try a different park chain next time."
379,2017-1,"It’s a racket. Pay your parking pass and then be told they are at capacity and don’t refund your money. They sure are doing more than capacity. Very disappointed in the way they are doing business. Ridiculous!,!!"
380,2017-1,This pretty lady is the best ever STAFF from guest services. Very helpful and very kind. She would do everything to help you when facing an issue or problem. Her performance is ABOVE & BEYOND anyone I met here. She helped me resolve an issue no one else could. Thanks Kristen.. All the best
381,2017-1,"My family and I spent 8 long, miserable hours there yesterday, and I see it as a public service responsibility to share our experience. This park over books, which results in multiple rides closing their lines at a time due to having reached ‘capacity.’ As a result they suggest people go on their app and monitor wait times, which do nothing to let you know when the lines will re-open. When we asked for a solution to that problem, they suggested we reserve a time to return through the ‘virtual’ feature on their app. When we tried to do that the app told us that all of the virtual spots gad been filled. When we asked how to fix that issue, they told us that virtual spots open every 2 hours, on the exact hour. So at 2 pm when the app started to take our reservation, it locked us out midway (as we were literally typing our name), saying the spot had just been taken by someone else. When we returned to the minion line to explain what happened and that we have been trying to get on this line for over 2 hours, being recognized by the ticket woman, they still said no, the supervisor (blond hair in a ponytail, blue eyes) said he would not make an exception. It did not help that we had arrived at 8:30 in the morning to purchase express passes, which by then had sold out. Adding to this, the pizza was raw, there was little social distancing monitored except in some lines, and they gave you a pea-sized squirt of sanitizer before every ride (good luck tracking down a full dispenser after). If you don’t have a problem walking a few miles glued to your phone, hoping you will get a virtual reservation after all of the best rides (Harry Potter escape from Gringotts, Minions, Mummy, and Jimmy Fallon Race through NY) close their lines, and if once you get on a line you don’t mind waiting over 2 hours, then Universal Studios may be a good match for you. For us however, the bottom line is that we rode 2 rides in 8 hours. This was a surprise Christmas gift for our kids, we had posted our anticipation all over Facebook on Christmas morning, and we left in tears with my husband having to carry our 9 year old on his shoulders she was exhausted as we all were by walking mikes to catch a ride without avail. By the end of it, Andrea at Guest Services acted as though she were doing me a favor by giving us a refund. I told her We deserved the refund *and* free express passes for this heap of nonsenses. This was the centerpiece of a $6K vacation for us, ending in apologies to our kids and more tears. Don’t go here. It’s pouring money in a drain and risking your and your family’s health and safety due to rampant COVID noncompliance."
382,2017-1,"We came the week before Christmas and had the best time! We felt very safe with tons of sanitizer stations, temperature checks, employees there specifically to monitor mask compliance, and employees specifically there to squirt hand sanitizer onto your hands before entering a ride. There were 6 foot markers all over the park. We stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel, so we had Express Pass, which was AWESOME! We never waited more than 10 minutes for any ride except for Hagrid's. Diagon Alley is really quiet if you go the last 2 hours before closing. We appreciated that Universal still had so much to offer while Disney has cancelled so much of their entertainment (which is why we cancelled out Disney trip). The Christmas decorations were gorgeous and I just can't say enough how much we enjoyed our time at the parks. We were sad that the Grinchmas show was cancelled as well as the castle light show, but understand how crowded those areas are. We loved the Cinematic Spectacular though!"
383,2017-1,"Disclaimer: I am a die hard Disney fan. However, no land in Disney holds a candle to Diagon Alley. The detailing, immersive nature and even the entrance being designed to take you “through a wall” are second to none. So- here we are.  This rating is purely based on my experience during the pandemic. Here are the PROS, the CONS and TIPS and what to expect.  PROS: As mentioned- Diagon Alley is unparalleled. It’s just fantastic. Buy an interactive wand, it’s worth it. King’s Cross Station- again, platform 9 3/4 is just great. Get a park to park ticket if you and to take the train, and take it from both directions. Worth it.  CONS: As much as I love Diagon Alley (and I do, I REALLY do), the rest of the park is, well... MEH. Don’t get me wrong, there are a few must do’s- Bourne Show is incredible, and Minion Mayhem is great- but nothing really holds a candle to HP land... and EVERYONE knows it. If there are a hundred people in the park, 99 of them will be in Diagon Alley. Prepare for this. If it is a crowded day, DA will be absolutely packed and if you can’t see the details, you honestly miss it. Don’t just flock to Gringott’s (though this queue and ride is great). This brings me to...  WHAT TO EXPECT: COVID precautions in some areas are apparent and in other areas not. First, the positive- ride line spacing is great. Very spaced and people generally followed. Mask wearing is enforced. Sanitizer is plentiful and ride cars are spaced. However, big negative- the park advertises 35% capacity. No way. Not even close. Every ride was over 1 hour wait. Most over 2 hours. Virtual queues were worse. I’ve been to Disney on days crowds were 9 or 10. This was more crowded. I felt less exposed in a ride queue than walking on the street. Universal DOES not have reserve spots right now. This means if you buy a ticket, and show up and the park is at capacity, you cannot get in. And if you do get in, and capacity is maxed, you will wait at least an hour for EACH ride. Note- this could be because of our travel dates, yes, BUT...  TIPS: If you choose to travel now, know that Universal does not reserve tickets. You might experience low crowds OR you might be denied. If you choose to go, stay on site if possible. You not only get priority entry, you get an hour before opening- this is crucial. Use it. We arrived at the gate by 630, and inside by 7. From there, we were able to experience DA without massive crowds, and more importantly, do other things and leave before the heaviest crowds. We did not experience massive crowding or lack of distancing, but again, we went early, followed the floor markers and did just a few things per day. And left before crowding occurred."
384,2017-1,"Be very careful when purchasing multiple day tickets for Universal. They are overselling during Covid. Thousands of people being turned away at 8:30 a.m. because the parks were ""at capacity"". We had their buy 2 get 3 free tickets and could not get in. They need to have reservations like Disney. Paid $26 for parking and so far haven't recovered it. Very disappointed. Not the way to run a business."
385,2017-1,"Do not buy tickets. Social distancing and allowing less people in the park is a lie. Universal is selling more tickets than the park has capacity for. The amount of people in the park is ridiculous and aside from mask, the park is not doing anything to keep guest safe. I attempted to go 12/29. Every adult ride had a 2-9 hour wait, while those without a virtual line were at capacity the entire day.  The virtual line is a joke. I attempted to sign up for several rides using this method. However every time I attempted to sign up. I was told the time slot was no longer available. The virtual line only allow you to attempt to check in at 11am. 2 and 3pm. All rides were “at capacity” the entire day.  Universal is scheming people out of money. Knowing the person will be unable to get into the park or unable to ride any rides, due to the extreme wait times.  I have waited 2+ hour for a ride before, but I did not have to wait an extended amount of time for every single ride. I had a wonderful time my first two times in the park in 2018 & 2019, but after this. I do not think I will be returning"
386,2017-2,"Worst part of our vacation. We returned as part of our family Christmas vacation hoping to enjoy the Harry Potter exhibit. Everything was packed. No places to eat without a two hour wait. Prices are outrageous, staff inept, no one was controlling crowds so you didn’t know what you were in line for or even if you were in a line. Universal is not equipped to handle this kind of capacity, obviously. Compared to Disney World, which has this crowd control thing down to a science. Wish we would have used our Universal money for another day at DW. I doubt we will return. BTW, as of this writing, we’ve been in line at a SANDWICH SHOP for one and a half hours and still don’t have food. Stat away! You’ll thank me later."
387,2017-2,The park reached capacity at 9am and they won't allow me to get a refund. On top of that our online tickets had a system error that caused us to wait in line for an additional 2 hours the day before. Needless to say I will not becoming back to universal......... EVER!!! I recommend everyone go to Disney because they have better customer service during the covid era.
388,2017-2,"Both parks are absolutely fabulous but Studios has a special place in my heart. The shows are amazing. If you can, go to the Horror Makeup Show. It is not scary at all and is truly hilarious."
389,2017-2,"Do not buy tickets to Universal, they are selling tickets to thousands of people who will never be able to get in the park! Do not waist your time or money! My boyfriend and I bought 2 day tickets a month ago. We flew down for our short vacation only to find out we could not get in the park due to capacity! So Universal Studios continues to sell tickets even though they know you can’t possibly get in the park! As I said, we purchased the tickets a month ago and chose the dates Dec 28 and 29 for the purchase. We waited in line for 2 hours at guest services to see what type of compensation we could receive. Guest services told us they were still selling tickets as of yesterday to people for Dec 28th. Our day we booked a month ago and couldn’t get in. And for all this they gave us nothing! Only a refund for the park tickets! What about our flights? What about our hotel? What about the time off work? I know they can’t reimburse for all of those but at least offer park tickets for our next trip to Florida? Nope. Absolutely nothing! I can’t express enough how disgusted I am with Universal."
390,2017-2,We got here since 8.20am after long walk and lines to get in we found the theme parks are at capacity since 9am. This is the 2nd day happened to us. We bought 2days tickets but we couldn't use any and we have to leave and go home. Poor customer service! They only let people in their resorts in first. We want our money back!!
391,2017-2,"Worst park experience ever - info on website did not match info in the park - guest services failed to explain how assistance pass worked - luckily a really nice ride operator explained it - can only ride rides with a fast pass but you can’t buy those or you have to spend almost as much as the ticket to get in. I check park notifications and COVID info to try to get a feel for how things would work - except neither one of those told you most of the rides only worked with virtual line which were never available - bought a dining pass but it didn’t work with mobile ordering so either had to stand in line for an hour or pay full price - there were park personnel standing everywhere with signs that said line starts here but nothing telling you what you were standing in line for - second day here the parks reached capacity before 9:30 am but they still keep letting people in - NO ONE WAS COMING FOR CITY WALK. - they were coming for the park but sure let’s let 100s of people in - this park has no idea how to work lines, their assistance pass system is horrifying, their surge pricing for fast passes is despicable - as they say - ONE STAR - DO NOT RECOMMEND."
392,2017-2,"🤮🤮🤢It’s infested of people even with COVID, we came at 7:00am and its already everything at maxed capacity and you cannot enter any game, its a waste of your money and time, do not come, they should really give priority to tourists, they charge $250 for one park a day and residents can come any time."
393,2017-2,"Went for holidays and holiday parade etc. Not the same holiday feel as other parks this time of year.  Can probably do both parks somewhat easily with either fast pass or single rider. However, would recommend save money and use single rider rather than fast pass. Save the money. Single rider just as efficient.  I went around holidays and wait times and crowds were not bad at all. Didn't find anywhere appetizing for a meal at this park. Missed a water fountain show of some sort.  There are some fun rides , really cool but after awhile start to seem a little bit all the same after a while but great for first timers. First timers should love it!  Best Diagon Alley (not a ride) but don't miss ice cream shop there, though line is long. Escape from Gringots Hollywood Rip Rockit - Roller coaster choose own music Transformers Simpsons fun if never done Jimmy Fallon ride is a little different and fun Minions Shrek Fast and Furious is fun if never done before  Disappointing ET Men In Black Revenge of Mummy over too fast Annoying to always put bags/purses in lockers"
394,2017-2,"Went to Universal Studios and was disappointed. First the place was crowded, the line to get your temperature checked was extremely long. There was no safe distancing, no sanitizing stations and the mask issue was not enforced .  Walked out and demanded a refund. Stay away I& you care about your health."
395,2017-2,Harry Potter pavilion is over crowded and nobody from the administration seems to take care about it. There is no way to keep the distance because nobody controls the amount of people who are coming into the Harry Potter part of the park. If you want to get infected go there
396,2017-2,"I’ve been to Universal many, many times. This was my first Covid visit and as requested we all tried to maintain social distancing guidelines etc. Whilst ordering some ice cream at Harry Potter World I asked another guest to please maintain their distance and while ordering the employee rudely asked we order and “move, move”. When I asked to not yell and give me time to order she was abruptly rude and explosive. My response was simple: “this doesn’t happen at Disney”. The employee was not representative of an experience one pays good money for. You’d think the park would be extra appreciative of guests visiting during these Covid times but maybe it’s just wishful thinking on my part. Thumbs down for Universal Studios Orlando this time."
397,2017-2,"If you are a huge Harry Potter fan, those parts of the park you would highly appreciate. I would give it a 3/5 for that specifically.  However....be prepared to wait a minimum of an hour for every single ride. Went in at 9, was able to ride two rides before lunch time. Social distancing was highly enforced when waiting in line. When you exit the ride, the main common areas are out of control. You’re literally running into people because it’s so crowded. If you’re worried about COVID, you definitely don’t want to come here. Everyone has there mask on, and that’s about it.  We were willing to pay for a fast pass at its advertised base rate, but they increase the rate/day based on the demand. $190+ for a one day fast pass!?! No thanks! Virtual Lines on the app are a joke. Either it won’t let you pick a time at all or you pick a time, the app takes forever to load, and then it says the time you just clicked on isn’t available anymore. (My phone is a new, updated iPhone, so I know it’s in fine working condition)  Many of the rides are some variation of sitting in a seat and watching the action in 3D. At least Disney has more interactive, real rides; not majority screen based with 3D glasses.  We’re going to try to go back at night to see if that helps ride times go down. If not, we’ll happily look at other things to do in Orlando and spend our money somewhere else."
398,2017-2,My family went to Universal Orlando Park for the Grandkids birthday we had a wonderful time. I was very please how they kept us safe. While waiting in line we saw the employee do very good cleaning
399,2017-2,"Right when you show up at opening you are greeted with at a minimum 50 minute lines for everything, so you ride 2 attractions by noon and then the rest of the lines are 2 or 3 hours at this point. Virtual lines??? Ha, no way of getting on those, even though we tried all day. And then other attractions are at full capacity. So we left and got lunch outside of universal, because if you eat there, its another hour wait. I know what you're thinking, we should have bought the express pass. We were going to but they jacked those prices up to $200 per person. We paid over $100 for a regular ticket, but we got to pay 3 tines that to get on the rides? Social distancing, forget about it. Shoulder to shoulder as you walk through the park. The only positive thing i can say is that the few attractions we were able to get on were fun, but not worth the time and money spent. They let in way to many people so that they can make their millions. Too bad, I was excited to go, but now we are trying to figure out what to do the rest of our trip."
400,2017-2,Absolute waste of 700 dollers. Took 3 hours to get through one ride. Unless you can afford another 200 a piece for express plan on spending your entire time sitting on a sidewalk waiting to get on a ride. Staff does not care. Did one ride which took half the day and left. It is basically a glorified shopping mall that you really cant afford to shop in. Don't waste your time. Seven hundred for 4 people and did ONE RIDE.
401,2017-2,"If I could give zero stars, I would. We planned this trip as a Christmas gift for our 3 kids. By the time we got in the park, the lines were already 100+ minute wait time. We were told to sign up for the virtual lines but those were gone in seconds. We had a disability pass. When we used the disability pass, it was fine for Gringots but when we went back for our reserved time at Fast and Furious , we were told the ride was at capacity and we’d have to come back to try again. What’s the point of reserving a time, if they’re just going to turn us away. Then, we decided to forego the disability pass and just wait in the regular line, only to be told they were only taking Express pass and Virtual Line reservations. Basically, we paid $1100 for a glorified shopping mall. Not only that but the staff was extremely rude. We had to walk around for over an hour, to find somewhere to eat that wasn’t a two hour wait. By then we were nauseous and exhausted, only to be turned away at every ride we went too. At this point we had only been there for 4 hours and miserable. Our person with a disability took their mask off as they were exiting, only to be followed by a security person, who felt the need to pretend to do their job. We went to guest services to seek a refund, only to encounter more hassle because we purchased our tickets from a military facility. The manager, Ryan, told us we’d end up owing more money than we paid for the tickets. Or we’d have to wait 16 weeks for a 3rd party to refund us our money, just to find that to be incorrect after calling whatever number HE gave us. Ryan the manager also took our tickets, saying we’re surrendering them. Now we’re in Orlando, at Christmas, with no parks to go to. Not that we’d ever step foot in there, ever again! But boy oh boy, there was plenty of shopping to do. $80 for a Harry Potter backpack. $70 for a freaking sweatshirt. Thanks Universal for taking a massive dump on our Christmas. Finally, while they don’t seem to care much about social distancing they do have mask natzis all over. Don’t you dare take a drink while you’re waking. And by the way, feel free to smoke in their designated smoking in the CENTER OF THE PARK!"
402,2017-2,"Mardi Gras - I have never been to New Orléans Mardi Gras however this was so much fun and the food - oh it was so good, the parades were awesome and having park guest up on the floats throwing beads was fun. Great part atmosphere. I want to give a huge shout out to the cleaning cast members - as soon as the parade was over they were out there cleaning everything up so that wining minutes you had no idea a parade had just gone through."
403,2017-2,"Had a great time at Universal Studios Dec 14th - yes during a pandemic - arrived by 9am - temperature checked at City Walk entry; attractions opened at 10am. Fortunately they had an rest area where you can take off the mask while you wait. There was staff cleaning tables. Prior to attractions entry - staff administered hand sanitizer to EACH guest - young and old! Loved the extra pre-cautions!! There was also sanitizer upon exiting. NO single riders. Since I went alone, I had a ride to myself for Simpson and Minions rides. Fast & Furious - they seated every other row. . I saw - at least two attractions - where staff was getting ready to spray seats while we were exiting. Other attractions like Bourne Stuntacular, 3 seats were left vacant per family/group. Also, there were staff around the park with signs reminding everyone about masks. Again had a great time!"
404,2017-2,Its just as crowded as before covid. Hand sanitizer smells bad. Doesn't seem customer friendly. Not very clean safe or festive
405,2017-2,"We visited in August 2017 staying at Sapphire Falls resort. Everything was wonderful. We were looking forward to going again this year, but due to COVID, it didn’t happen. So looking forward to returning when things are back to normal. The thing that impressed me most was the reasonable price of the hotel rooms. For the price we paid for 1 room at Disney world, we got 2 connecting rooms at Sapphire Falls. Unlike Disney, Universal does not try to suck every penny from your pocket. Hotel rooms, food, and park tickets are all more reasonable and the experience is just as good, if not better. Try Universal, stay in one of their hotels. You will be impressed."
406,2017-2,So much for the family! Harry Potter World is a lot of fun. My son loved the NY ride and my daughter the Simpson's ride. Lots to do!
407,2017-3,"I was part of the Orlando meetup group. Event was from 2-12 Friday and 3-130 am Saturday.  I’m not a large guest, but i am a 6 foot 1woman athletic build. My sister in law came and she is think on her bottom half of her body with a gut. So i researched what rides would accommodate and if you are a bigger person, rides such as spider man, transformers, jimmy kimmel, Simpsons, men in black should work out. Maybe even forbidden forest. I’ve seen bigger people manage to get on the hagrids ride as well. It all depends on body type. But the before rides for sure will work. Rides like the mummy and gringotts bank,not so much.  So i took my sister in law on forbidden Journey. The guy NEIL, tall African American guy was able to get her in the ride and had her relax her arms. The second time we got on they attempted to push it down once made us get off and didn’t even tell us what was happening. So i told them we’ve rode before, they offered a test seat. I said we did test seat and rode BEFORE. They attempted it again and then made us get off again.  So i went all the way down and found Neil and told him could He help us get on because we just rode, he got my sis in law again back on the ride.  They need to teach everyone how to help larger guests get on the rides. I understand there are restrictions and body types matter but to barely help, seen so many ppl get booted off. It was sad.  And what’s crazy is for the hagrids ride? Even hagrid wouldn’t fit. I really hope down the road they consider supporting more body types, there are so many bigger people walking universal than anyone else.  On Saturday; i waited 1 hour to ride gringotts bank and the ride broke and so we were stuck on the track and eventually forced to finish the ride the opposite way of the screen which messed up the experience.  I had no issues getting on ride but was asked to do test seat for hagrids which is possible it’s standard as they did ask if it was my first time. there was a moment i thought i wouldn’t be able to ride but i was able to click in.  If i didn’t have the meet up which allowed me to ride rides after the park closed, i would of never been able to experience hagrids.the lines are socialcdistances as much as they could have been and there are a ton of single riders due to COVID so you’re waiting longer than pre COVID times I’m sure. The virtual line didn’t work most of the time i was there. The line was so long some ppl waited hours for just a 3 minute experience. The experience is amazing but such a long line it goes so deep you have never seen how far the line can go until you’ve done this ride.  The park was at capacity most of the trip so if i didn’t have the meet up, i wouldn’t of been able to do much if anything at all. Unless you stay on a resort and can experience park early you’ll be on waitlist for basically everything and walking around with barely any place to sit. It was WAY too many people there for the park to say it was safe. Harry Potter world a disaster. The biggest attraction there obviously and no social distancing could possibly be done unless you were in gringotts bank waiting to ride the ride.  So if you’re going during COVID understand if you don’t go early and plan to spend all day there you will not be able to do much.  The last time i was here pre COVID and pre hagrids ride, i was able to do at least 10-13 rides in a day and eat twice and get butter beer 4 times. and i spent most of my day at Harry Potter world and rode express back and forth.  I tried to replicate that trip and it was impossible. I was there from 2-12 am. Because again the meet up started once park closed. I was only able to do 6 rides. Even with park closed it was just so many people and there is just So much walking.  Just prepare for a minimum 3 day trip so you can at least experience every ride you want ONCE.  So i rated this 3 out of 5 due to them not accommodating body types like they need to. (Disney is better at this). For literally allowing the park to be at capacity, you can’t do shut when this occurs FYI. I was even told if i left the park(which you have to, to get to other park if you have both tickets, if you choose not to do hogwarts express which was a 2 hour wait) i wouldn’t be able to re enter which wasn’t true at all.  Train your staff better on policies and getting people to snap into their seats safely , accommodate your larger guests and stop discriminating."
408,2017-3,"It’s a lot of walking but you don’t notice it, till the end of the night. We ate dinner in the park and found everything we needed. The rides are great and if you take lift, it’s pretty easy and fast to get into the park. I’d highly recommend going in December. The Christmas decorations make it more special. It’s also less packed. I do advise an express pass if you can afford it. It’s well worth it. We stood in line to get on the train for an hour and most rides had an hour wait time. If you want to hit every ride in one day, you will need an express pass. If you can’t afford it, I suggest getting to the park before the gates open and be the first in the gate to save time. Then take a big break for a few hours during power times and eat lunch or just rest a bit, then get back in lines after 6, to hit more rides. It’s a must experience. If your a Harry Potter fan this is an AWSOME time."
409,2017-3,"Husband and I went in November and it was mostly great. You MUST have a smartphone as almost everything is done online, ie. food ordering, restaurant reservations, checking ride wait times, etc. so make sure phones are charged and someone is good at navigating this way. Maps are not available at all. I can see where it would be frustrating without a Fastpass, but fortunately we went on days that weren't busy. In order to see all of Harry Potter world, you must go to BOTH parks but you can't ride the train unless you have a Parkhopper pass, which we didn't so that was annoying. We can't ride all the crazy coasters anymore so it was extremely frustrating, downright DISCRIMINATING that we were refused on the Pterodactyl ride because we didn't have a child with us! If it's a weight issue than post a weight limit! I know parents of kids that weigh more than we do combined. Would've sat in different seats even. Complete B.S. that only some adults get to ride! Louie's had good Italian fast food and reasonably priced. Harry Potter Forbidden Journey was the coolest ride I've ever experienced! Loved King Kong too. Purchased a dinner/movie combo online before we went and of course it's a limited menu. Antojitos was decent, loved the live entertainment! So the next night we go to use our coupon & the sandwich shop had never heard of this deal but were very nice and accepted our tickets. Then we watched Guardians of the Galaxy on the big screen. A very nice way to unwind before heading back to our hotel. Overall we had a good time but have no plans on going back. Bucket list destination, check."
410,2017-3,COVID-19 precautions were great! Had a fun time! Definitely worth my money! The Harry Potter section was fun and interactive!
411,2017-3,"My husband and I are slowly but surely checking off Orlando theme parks to visit each time we are in Orlando. This year, we visited Universal Studios. My husband and I are in our twenties, and we went to the park with our friends. We enjoyed the park for about 4 hours then we were ready to go. I think with smaller children there are more attractions to visit plus during the pandemic many attractions were limited, or not even open. We entered the park right at opening and went straight for Gringotts which I highly recommend. There was hardly a line and this ride is awesome. I wasn't a Harry Potter fan until after this ride and wandering around Diagon Alley. The Transformers attraction was also a good time. We didn't make it on the Minion ride because of the line, but if I visit again, that would be a must. I am very impressed with the cleanliness of the park, especially during the pandemic. The bathrooms were remarkably clean for the number of people frequenting the park daily."
412,2017-3,"Go here if you’re in Orlando! We had to take some crazy timeshare tour by Westgate to get a discount on our tickets but after saying no 100x to the person trying to get us to get the timeshare we were on our way. Universal itself is amazing! So beautiful and definitely do Citywalk! The drinks, the food, the atmosphere is awesome!! Voodoo doughnuts was so good! Unfortunately hardly any of the Harry Potter rides were open on the Universal Orlando side but the one that was open was sooo good! I’m terrified of coasters but I would do it again! Had an awesome time here."
413,2017-3,Let me begin by saying they should keep the safety measurements in place post Covid-19.  Hand sanitizer everywhere.  Staff holding sign to remind you to wear your mask and to wear it properly.  Blue ground markings to remind you to social distance.  Temperature taken prior to park entry.  Small wait times.  The most crowded area was Harry Potter area.
414,2017-3,They are doing a great job with make visitors/guests fell safe! I can't wait to bring the kids back! 11/29/20 - 12/02/20 very low attendance.
415,2017-3,"I was extremely impressed when I first got to Universal! We were staying on the property and I liked how our temperature was taken daily before we could get on the bus to the parks. The bus limited capacity and mandated masks which made us feel quite comfortable. When you got to the park hand sanitizer stations were abundant as well as signage stating social distancing and mask rules. Lines were kept spread apart and aside from a few people who couldn’t follow those directions (which I quickly told to back up) most people abided by them.  Then came Harry Potter world. What a DISASTER. It was crowded, there was no social distancing unless it was in a line, and the only sign that there was a pandemic was that people were wearing face masks. Luckily we got early admission into the park by staying on property so we were able to bop on a couple HP rides before the gobs of people swarmed in. After 10am hit we left that part of the park simply for fear of being around so many people. No one was enforcing distancing which, I get, can be a near impossible task, but something more needed to be done. Maybe if the capacity into HP world itself was limited and virtual lines were always in effect it would have some crowd control. I really wanted to enjoy diagon alley, but since that park didn’t have early admission during the week we were barely able to. There were just too many people to feel safe there. It was so unfortunate.  We wound up cutting our trip short by 2 days because the weekend was coming and it was getting crowded. We left today (supposed to leave Monday) - went to the park for the early admission, changed our flight, and flew home. Today the lines were insane just to get into the park. There was a noted difference between early and general admission, albeit smaller today (Friday) than Wednesday and Thursday. As soon as the park opened for general admission it was like a wall of people went dashing for HP world. Seriously though, there was a roped off section by Dr Seuss landing and there was a giant crowd of people not following social distancing protocols AT ALL. Once 10am hit they swarmed in, some running, to get in line. It was crazy. I was so disappointed by that. I get it, Harry Potter is a money maker for the park, but allowing that many people to congregate in one small space is just ridiculous. Luckily we went during the week for the first part of our trip or I would not have lasted one day.  All in all we felt safe when we were in lines and walking around the park as long as it was during the hour of early admission or not in Harry Potter world. I sanitized on my own at the lockers before and after the rides and when sanitizer was given to me prior to boarding. It was, on average, 4 sanitizes per ride experience (3 of which were my own doing at park provided stations). So. Much. Sanitizer. When possible I would find a bathroom that was off the beaten path to go wash my hands the old fashion way. In bathrooms located in high traffic areas it was, for lack of a better saying, a sh*t show. There were people at every sink and hand dryer shoulder to shoulder. It was crazy. If you go, find a more secluded spot to relieve yourself and wash your hands.  Most of the staff did a good job making sure people were wearing masks properly, however, there were still several people wearing them under their nose.  Before we went I watched a ton of videos of people in the park but I guess I didn’t research enough inside Harry Potter world because that probably would have changed my mind."
416,2017-3,"Purchased a meal deal at citywalk and went to margaritaville. Worst decision I've ever made in my life. Waiter snatched my ticket from my table and never gave me my diet coke I asked 3 times for. Flagged down another waiter.  Very unpleased, waiter left a bad taste in my mouth."
417,2017-3,Universal did an amazing job during this pandemic. The park was very clean. Everyone wore masks. We stayed on property which made it very convenient for kids to get to the parks.
418,2017-3,"Absolutely adore this place! Universal Parks are definitely my theme park of choice in Orlando area. Harry Potter world is just incredible, especially Diagonal Alley that’s in this specific park. It’s jaw-dropping, literally feels like you’ve been teleported into the movie. The Escape to Gringotts ride is a great ride too. The Mummy and Rip Ride Rockit are my other favorites, just great classic roller coasters with a little added touch. Men in Black is fun to get a change of pace and go shoot down some aliens. There are a bunch of fun virtual rides like the Minion ride, Transformers, Fast and Furious, Simpsons, Shrek and more. The ET ride, hidden at the way back is super cute too and a great one for the kiddos. They also have constant shows being performed and different movie characters walking around taking pictures and interacting with people. Covid-wise I feel that they have done a great job being organized and taking needed measures. If you aren’t wearing your mask properly they are sure to politely correct you. Social distancing in lines and on rides they make sure to separate each party. They also have “U Rest” areas where you can go sit and take your mask off and get a break from it, I think that’s super considerate and I definitely used those areas a few times in my visits. I just love Universal, even though everything is overpriced (like all theme parks) the experience is always worth it and such a great time."
419,2017-3,"Family of 5 (two adults, 8, 6 & 6) about $750 spent for one day ($657 +/- on tickets alone)  We were hoping to get the Veteran’s/Military discount but that doesn’t apply on Tuesdays.  Wow. What a disappointment.  Dede was working ET and was rude to my husband and 8-year-old son when the ride broke down today (Dec. 1). We were next in line to ride and got held up a while.  We couldn’t find a paper maps anywhere so we were looking down at our phones the whole time trying to get everything situated. Ordering food at one of the restaurants was very frustrating because it was done through the app.  We accidentally went past the time limit on the free lockers and had to pay about $30 extra for all of us. That just soured the experience—because everything was soooooooo expensive—we felt very nickeled and dimed for everything. And for what we paid, it was disappointing.  And for the kids and gift shops—most everything was $10+. There was a pair of plastic Minion glasses for $16 😱 and you can get a package of boys underwear (5 pairs) for $26!!! The same stuff they sell at Walmart!!!!  I know the prices are going to be marked up but it is just an exorbitant amount.  Please lower your prices so more families’ pockets won’t be pinched so bad and more kids can enjoy the parks!"
420,2017-3,"Due to the new ""virtual line"" you will be discriminated against if you do not have a smartphone. Basically the people who are the richest with the fastest phone are the only ones that will be able to ride the new Hagrid ride. We talked to a family in line who all had the new Iphones and they were able to go on the ride multiple times because they reserved spots for their whole family on their different phones. Meanwhile I've gone to the park, paid for parking every time, and haven't been able to go on (I do have a smartphone, it's just not a very expensive fast one). If you call to give a review they say the best they can do is tell you is to go during the week (impossible for working families, I'm a teacher), get there early (I've done this every weekend I've gone), and keep refreshing the app (really takes away from the fun of universal to have to be staring at your phone constantly refreshing, just for you to never be able to get on the ride). I've been to Universal/IOA 5 times since this ride open and still have never been able to ride this ride because of the ""Virtual line"". I've had to pay $26 every time for parking, but if you tell Universal that their only option is ""pay us more money for a more expensive pass that includes parking, then you can come up here more often, but you still may not get on the ride"" I don't mind waiting 2+ hours to ride a ride I really want to ride. It's absolutely heartbreaking to not be able to get on the ride because your poor and don't have a good enough phone so they won't let you even get in line.  I called guest services to try to understand better how the line works and the lady I spoke to Mikayla was so rude, in the middle of me talking about my experience she cut me off and said ""Well if you let me finish I can tell you my tips (what I listed above)"" Basically she didn't want to hear any feedback about the park, only read a script she is told to read to the customers. I asked to speak to someone else and she said she is capable of getting my message to others. I don't know how she plans to do that since she wouldn't even listen to my experience. I always loved Universal, but there current virtual line system, rude employees (some are very nice, but some are extremely rude), and lack of customer service (they used to be much better)."
421,2017-3,Poorly advertised their adjusted conditions for what to expect when coming into the park. This was ran like a struggling company trying to make a dollar instead of a multi billion dollar company. Worse experience I have had at a park. Disney would never. I will never go back to Universal. I will be back at Disney because it runs and functions like a well oiled multi billion dollar company that cares about your experience.
422,2017-3,They're trying but not enough. So many times it's impossible to social distance and way too many people take their masks off. Don't be surprised if you go and come back with covid. It sucks really the staff are nice and deserve the work but not enough is being done to keep you safe.
423,2017-3,Our family of five spent the last 4 days at Universal Studios. It was our first time visiting Universal/Disney and it was such a great experience. Lots of great staff members and Universal but Lauren E on on the Hague’s ride went above and beyond!! She did all that she could to ensure that our family had a great experience. We rode this ride once daily for the last 4 days and Universal should be proud to have a wonderful employee like Lauren!
424,2017-3,Park is fine I would never stay at the Wyndham hotel ever. Terrible customer service and accommodations.
425,2017-3,I really didn't enjoy this theme park. What a waste of money. But this is jut my opinion. The wait time for rides were extremely long and this was during the slow time.
426,2017-3,"Today my family and I spent the day there and was there for only 1 hour. Every ride was 60 to 120 wait time, the park was at its capacity. There were some employees and supervisors being rude to people, not greeting no one, no smile on their face. I felt this is a unhappy environment and unfair. It’s ridiculous the park keep allowing more people in and the park is full. There were a lot of undercover agents in secrets walking around with a evil look, one was watching me and I feel uncomfortable being there. My family and I deserve to be at another theme park that fits us better, too many secretive people undercover will watch you making it uncomfortable. 2020 is already difficult and now this park was the worst I’ve experienced. The Macy parade was cancelled, it was only two haunted houses and then a unexpected haunted house happened on Halloween. The boat anchor in front of the SpongeBob store look like two penis and the alien voice on the E.T sounds like it’s saying “Welcome home, you will d**”. I hope when I come back to this place, things will change, but for now, my family and I are going somewhere better."
427,2017-3,"Food and food service in park is pretty bad so get your food at one of the several restaurants on City Walk. Hard Rock is a standout. Park is clean with some very good rides. Friendly staff. The Harry Potter Hagrid motorcycle ride is the best coaster I have ever been on, hands down. Lots of 4D rides with Transformers, Spider-Man , and Harry Potter as the Standouts. The Simpsons 4D was good as well. The Rocking roller coaster was also a great ride. Shrek Theater ‘4D’ is dated and lame. King Kong 4D was decent. Fast and Furious is only worth it if there is no line."
428,2017-4,My favorite ride here is Escape from Gringotts and the Mummy. For the family Men is black is really run.
429,2017-4,"I am going to give an honest review of both parks and our hotel. I know I will get some crappy canned response from Universal's Customer service as they really don't seem to care or want to really listen to what people are saying so just know that yeah yeah safety blah blah, comfortable guest experience blah sorry you blah blah, yeah i've heard and read it before so just don't with the canned response. Ok, here goes the review.  We decided to go and stay for 5 days, totally don't ever spend 5 days here, not worth it, We went to both parks, forwent the water park as i didn't want to get COVID from people not wearing masks (which is improbable at a water park) so first park I'm going to review is this one, Universal.  1st day we arrived we stopped first for lunch as we were hungry, we went to the Today Cafe, the food was awful, my husband has a disorder where he shakes, I asked the young woman to please not fill his drink all the way up as they don't have lids, what does she do, she OVERFILLS the cup so i had to hold his cup for him until he could get enough drink down where it wouldn't spill if he held the cup.  Here are the kudos, we did notice constant cleaning, all staff wearing gloves and masks signs everywhere and every guest wearing a mask or being told to wear one then handed one if they didn't have a proper mask (don't wear anything with a vent people, you will be told to remove it and given a paper mask to wear until you spend 10 bucks on one of theirs)  We rode a few rides as it was late in the day, one of them being the Mummy. I'm not young, i'm not skinny (i'm not so fat I need a scooter and i am not in the over size 18 jeans/pants) but I'm 49 and I have curves, boobs, hips etc, anyway to make a long story longer, we get on this ride, yes we fit, but we were thrown in the back of the car, then we were thrown around on the ride, seriously felt like my chunky butt was going to fly out of the car a few times, we never rode that again the rest of the time we were there, it was that bad.  We enjoyed pretty much all the rides, there were no real shows, it was very hot not super crowded so that was nice but here comes the rub: Harry Potters Escape from Gringotts, I have ridden this ride many times, we get up to the ride, i get in, the guy asks me to pull down on my bar, so i do, he tells me to keep pulling on it, ok so i push down, click click click, he says keep pushing at his point i'm in this thing so tight if i round a corner i puke up my organs, so i tell him i got it as far as i can push it, he then LOUDLY says well you don't fit, you're too big so unfortunately you can't ride but he can (meaning my husband who is bigger than i am) anyway i got little teens giving me the pitty look as i exit the vehicle and i shrug it off like ok fine i'm fat i'll go shop, well as i'm leaving I hear the same kid laughing so i turn and look at him and he's shooting me a look, well i think ok well he's a kid he has no manners life sucks i'm over it. Next day we go to the other Harry Potter at Islands of Adventure, I fit on the rides (well Hagrids wasn't working that day, but it worked a few days later and yup rode that neck breaking back hurting thrown you around holy crap i need a chiropractor now ride) shocker shocker, so i go back the next day to the Gringotts sit in the outside seat and i fit, not a problem, by this time i'm livid so we repeated the line and same kid working, i get in again with the ""you dont' fit"" so i asked for another attendant to come over, and click click click, i fit. So here is the rub with this, the kid might be new, he might not have been pushing it correctly but I feel that Universal's rides discriminate against those who are larger, I noticed alot of larger men and women and children and it's not cheap to go and they would be turned away from rides because they are larger. It's not fair to them, Disney's rides accommodate those who are larger, i get it there needs to be a limit to size but for the girl who is a size 18/22 who has hips and can't ride, or the guy who is 6'2 250 pounds and can't ride, the body builders, I mean c'mon you gotta look at everyone and not just those who are a size 2. Universal needs to understand that people are bigger than they used to be. Ok rant about size and discrimation over.  I'm going to move on to food now, we ate at Krusty Burger, i took ONE bite of my burger and nearly threw up, it was AWFUL, like horrible awful the most disguisting thing i've ever eaten. The manager was kind and got me something else, burned chicken strip that were dry and just as bad. Don't eat here, seriously it's that bad. We also ate dinner at Lombard's, food was ok, salty but ok, but the waitress....i think she was half awake. We were there for 2 hours, TWO. It took her forever to take our order, forever to bring our drinks, and well you get the point. We ate at City Walk most of the time, food seemed to be a bit better.  Anyway both parks i would say do 2 day park to parks, you can cover the entire place in that space of time. If you want the water park, wait until this COVID stuff is over so you can actually enjoy it. Over all it was ok, we won't be going back any time soon as i feel it wasn't a good value.  Here's my note for Universal Management and HR: Universal, train your staff better, and please for the love of god, look at your reviews, seriously you have LOTS and i do mean LOTS of complaints about your rides, seat sizes and how your employees can be insensitive to those who are larger/taller. You need to really work on this, and no i don't want your canned response about safety ok, read that too many times on these reviews."
430,2017-4,"(Due to Pandemic) I wanted to know toll cost & locations. Unable to get B/4 leaving, I'm sharing, hoping to help someone else. GA to FL (SB) entering @ Wildwood FL off 75 . Only 1 manned toll gate @ Leesburg, $3.25, they offer change, only other toll is at exit 75A -unmanned with sign saying DO NOT STOP your tag will be charged. Cost is 80 Cents."
431,2017-4,"My review is based on our time of visit, we were there the week after Halloween and before the Christmas events start and during COVID. As such, the parks were not terribly crowded. Everyone was temp checked on the way in or at the resort, masks were mandatory, social distancing was (generally) observed. Everyone got hand sanitizer on every ride and I saw staff sanitizing seats too. They seemed to be doing everything they could to keep visitors safe. That being said, I loved our trip, we rode everything, although a few rides were not running. Defiantly get the app to keep tabs on line times. We managed to ride everything in two days."
432,2017-4,"Going to Disney in Orlando is a confusing and problematic affair. Above that the parks have been neglected for decades. But there is a new king in town and it is Universal Studios Florida. Both Universal Studios, the movie park and Islands of Adventure are worth a visit. Customer service does remind you to the old days when WDW was amazing. The team members are a delight and a spontaneous exploration of the stunning attractions and food offerings is just wonderful. Both parks offer Harry Potter themed lands and yes they are the new standard in theme park experiences with stunning decor and world class attraction and shows but the resort has so much more to offer and you would do yourself a disservice not to visit the many wonderful attractions these resorts have to offer. My favorites In Universal Studios: Harry Potter Escape from Gringotts, The Hogwarts Express (you need a 2 day or hopper pass for this one, take the 2 day pass and thank me later) The Jason Bourn stuntspectular, The Mummy, Man in Black, Transformers and E.T.. And please don't miss the Horror and Make-up show and The Blues Brothers. My favorites In Islands of Adventure: The Hulk, Spiderman, Popeye, Kong, Jurassic Park River Adventure, Hogwarts, Hagrids Motorbike Adventure and the high in the sky Seuss trolley train ride (especially at night when the Christmas decorations are up)."
433,2017-4,"Starting this review as I’m at the park (Saturday 11/14/2020)... I’ve only been here for 30 minutes, and it’s been such a turn off... (getting through the temperature screening, security check, entrance line) SO CROWDED!!! The crowds are similar to before covid, almost like there’s no maximum limit with the capacity. Lines to get into the park were so crowded, so it’s hard for people to physical distance. There shouldn’t be an exception for the day of the week- just because it’s Saturday isn’t an excuse for it to be more crowded than normal. I definitely don’t feel safe here. (I was at DisneyWorld the past 4 days and the crowd/physical distancing handling is way better there. You must reserve your days before going to the parks, which I think is a much better idea.)  Physical distancing in the restaurants good. Stores: Absolutely impossible to physical distance inside stores, there’s no regulation of the capacity, there aren’t any clear indications of entrances and exits.  People are eating and drinking things in line with their masks off. Some aren’t following the physical distancing markers on the floor.  I want to give a shout out to the workers, they’re really trying their best to keep people safe and deal with people who don’t physical distance/wear their masks properly. The workers look drained from the crowd that’s been going on today. Some workers aren’t wearing proper masks, some have openings around their chin area. Universal should provide their workers with a standard mask or managers should make sure their workers are wearing the proper mask. If I worked here, I wouldn’t feel safe due to the crowds.  Overall, I honestly wish I didn’t come!"
434,2017-4,"Waste of time! You pay for s full ticket and cant hardly ride in anything. There are time limits, amount of people per ride per day, so, after getting here at 9 am, paying $138, we are yet to ride, every where we have made an attempt to go it has been unavailable and is already 12:35.. keep in mind they close at 5pm “WTH” They should say this before you spend your money! Waste of a day... Waste of Money..."
435,2017-4,"I must admit I’m and have always liked Universal Studios in Orlando. I’ve had tons of fun at this place, however I was doubtful about visiting during COVID. I was a bit worried the whole situation could drain all the fun out of the park experience, and worst of all it could turn out to be unsafe (from a health standpoint). Boy was I wrong! The park has done a remarkable job at keeping the whole experience as close as possible to the “normal” (pre-COVID) experience. All the rides were open and functioning, aside from one or two dining options, the rest of the dining venues were open, kiosks along the park were open, shows were ALL up and running. With that being said, one could expect longer waiting lines (due to social distancing) however they weren’t long at all. The most I had to wait for a ride was 30min.  Best of all (and I probably should have put this first) the park has done a stellar job at keeping everyone safe. Social distancing is the rule. People are kept at safe distances with lines on the floor to enforce social distancing, mask wearing is mandatory and aside from maybe a couple of idiots here and there who could care less about others, and were lowering their masks for no reason, everybody else was in perfect compliance. Hand sanitizer is dispensed by park attendants prior to getting on every ride which is absolutely outstanding.  If you need a “break from reality” while ensuring you are safe, I wouldn’t doubt going to Universal. If park staff read this, please keep it up!"
436,2017-4,"WARNING - if you change your reservation at a hotel, they do NOT change your park tickets if you bought a package. The hotel (in our case Royal Pacific) is separate from the park and do not communicate. We are seniors and had to stand in line for 90 minutes. They gave us a $10 gift card."
437,2017-4,"Our favorite Orlando destination! We are Annual Passholders, which is an amazing deal that provides unlimited park entry and discounts at the wonderful hotels and resorts on property. The parks are incredible with rides and streets that transport you to another place. The entire family will never forget the memories you make here!"
438,2017-4,"Have been enjoying both Universal parks since they first opened. Bought the 1 day/2 park ticket with unlimited visits thru Dec. 24 & no blackout dates. I am over 65 & am happy to say due to the sanitary, distancing & mask procedures in place, coupled with common sense, I am A-OK 2 weeks past my most recent visit. I chose the Universal deal over WDW because of the 2 haunted houses which were open thru Halloween. The houses were great as was the newest coaster Hagrid's Motorbike Adventure. Both parks have awesome attractions & IOA is my favorite, offering more thrill rides. Lines moved faster than expected due to social dist. Plenty of food options available. Staff was courteous & conscientious re: guest safety. Hope to go back several more times before the expiration date."
439,2017-4,"I was a little nervous going back to Universal as they have begun to re-open their parks again, but I greatly appreciated all of the precautions they have taken on their behalf to allow everyone to feel safe. Before we are allowed to reach the main area that checks our bags, everyone's temperature is taken and if it reaches a certain temperature, they will not allow the members to enter the park. What was great was the way that at each ride, there are painted markings on the ground that express where each person must stand to be 6 feet apart. I thought this system worked wonderfully without anything needed to be said. Everyone followed these guidelines the 4 days I was on vacation. What is also great is the way that the staff always has hand sanitizer on them and squirts a fair amount in everyone's hands right before entering the ride. Masks are required as well and everyone was doing their part. Wonderful experience overall and I felt super safe the whole trip with everyone doing their part to take the precautions that include the guests and staff!"
440,2017-4,Really liked the cleanliness and organization. The park employees were friendly and helpful. The best aspect was the app that gives estimates on wait times for each ride. The Harry Potter exhibits were really good but you need a pass to both Universal and Adventure island to see the whole thing. Overall the food options in the park are a bit limited but you can go the restaurant area just outside the park for more options.
441,2017-4,"In COVID times it’s a struggle to find something for the entire family to enjoy. Universal seems to have gone to ‘full court press’ on Disney because our experience was great. Clean, refillable soda, great rides short wait times and great prices on discounted tickets.  We enjoyed our experience, even with the masks."
442,2017-4,My husband and I love this park!! My absolute favorite part of this park is the wizarding world of Harry Potter. I am a huge Potter fan and it was an amazing experience to see and feel like I was in the movies. I highly suggest getting park-to-park passes to get the full Potter experience.
443,2017-4,"We came during this time because we knew ALOT of people were not traveling, for whatever reason. I loved that we didn't have to deal with the large crowds and crazy hot temps in Summer. We never waited longer than 20 minutes for a ride, and the weather was perfect!!"
444,2017-4,"Being passholder hold no benefit to staying in on site hotel as early access is offered to both but full park doesnt open which was dissapointing, we bypassed 30 min line when park opened for minions so kids could go to Barney land and ride woodpecker coaster only to be turned away after the walk saying it wouldnt open until an hour after the rest of the park. When we got back to Minions line was over 90 mins! With children and no virtual line option, this was not feasible so explored other parts of the park. Having reservations in Mythos at 1pm and line for train connecting both parks being over 2 hour wait, we had to go back to entrance and into front of other park to make our seating, would be more conveniant if there was another option for park to park access for passholders"
445,2017-4,"Harry Potter world was a little too busy for us to enjoy all of the rides, but we did love the chocolate frogs and butterbeer!"
446,2017-4,The Harry Potter Theme is the best! We drived with the Hogwarts Express from one park to the other park and back (both drives are different) it was so much fun!
447,2017-4,"Love the social distancing guidelines. Hand sanitizer everywhere including prior to getting on the ride (you don’t have a choice, it’s required) and as soon as you get off the ride. Most people following the social distance guidelines by standing at the floor markers provided. We’ve felt very safe during this visit! Minus the masks, we’re diggin this!! Although the masks aren’t that bad, just sweaty!"
448,2017-4,I liked a lot the attractions. They are exciting and the park is awesome but walking all day long using face cover was very exhaustive.
449,2017-5,"We go to Universal from Ohio about 3 times a year for the last 5 years. It used to be our favorite place to go, but we won't return until the restrictions are lifted. We understood we needed to wear a mask - we didn't need to be scolded and screamed at by ride attendants. In June 2020 when we went, the employees were simply rude about the masks. This time, in October 2020, they were completely insane. The ride attendant on the Hogwarts Express leered at my young children and barked at them that there was a camera watching our cabin and she would know if they took their mask off. We won't be returning until Karen Irwin gets her employees under control and lifts these insane restrictions. Also, the forced hand sanitizer at every ride is fine, except the sanitizer itself is disgusting, smells terrible, and feels like slime."
450,2017-5,Considering COVID Universal has taken great precautions with social distancing and sanitizing everyone’s hands prior to boarding rides. Feels safer than going to a Walmart. Also they still have express lines and a few virtual pass lines. They even have Characters come out and people can get selfies a safe distance away.  Sure hope CA lets them open.
451,2017-5,"The only thing l can think of is the song, “Everything is awesome!” Transformers, the Simpson virtual ride. I will admit Men in Black was a disappointment for all the bother of getting a locker to put your personal items in, it just simply didn’t warrant that much effort to ride."
452,2017-5,"Oct. 22 & 23, 2020 Resort early hour entrance was not a good experience! The employees had us line up in 2 lines. What we didn't know is the left line had 4 gates open and the right had a person pointing you to one of three gates. By the time we arrived at the gate, the other line had completely disappeared. Go to the left side lane, you'll get in faster! Also, you will need your hotel key card to go a little further in the park. If you go left, theres only a couple rides open - ask. If you go right side, then you can go all the way back to Harry Potter and ride more rides. The rest of park doesn't open until 10, so they won't let you go any further into the park until then. This might save you time. Never had any issues with employees enforcing masks or 6 foot distance. They are a little more relaxed than Disney World. There were many times where there were too many people and we just went the other way."
453,2017-5,"Loved it, unfortunately a lot of people didn’t stay the 6ft apart, but everyone wore masks... lines were longer and took forever but for health and safety reasons I completely understand!!"
454,2017-5,"Bought tickets from a private party since the tickets are so expensive and we were trying to save some money. The guy sent tickets electronically before we sent payment. Went the next morning at park opening to validate tickets, waited in line for 1 hour at entrance but left before they could be validated as we had plans to visit Epcot that morning and didn’t want to arrive late. Since we were not able to verify the validity of the tickets because the line was too long, we transferred the funds to the person. Needless to say, we’re now down $500 and at least 1 hour filing a police report. After a little investigation of our own, we found out that this guy is notorious for selling fraudulent tickets and has us many charges and arrests for selling them. Don’t purchase tickets from this guy. By the way, he doesn’t go by Branden Bullerin as he uses his brothers name, who does not appear to be involved so I blacked out his name on the ticket."
455,2017-5,"The employees were rude and harassed us while we were secluded in our own space and followed us to every area. When you enter they say it’s okay to slip your mask down to take a break yet we get threatened and more. They have made it extremely uncomfortable and the complete opposite of fun. The way the lines were set up was a time waster and no one would have had time to explore and enjoy all the rides and exhibits. It’s a rip off of the cost and money it take s to enjoy the park with the low respect and time to do anything. It is completely different from the last time my family has gone and it gets worse and worse. Instead of focusing on the comfortability and and having fun, employees rushed and only focused on keeping ur mask over your nose and hand sanitizer. It is unacceptable for they way the tourists are treated and it was unenjoyable. The times the rides were open is ridiculous and should’ve been open longer. Ever five minutes you had to put on hand sanitizers and if you were given too much normally you would wipe it off a bit but no the employees threatened, harassed, and followed you until you rubbed it all on. They focused more on being clean than enjoying your time here. I will never go again and I will tell everyone I know to not go."
456,2017-5,"We love Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure. I'm really glad we did not pay for the express passes. We visited on a Wed in mid Oct and did not wait long for any rides. We had to wear masks, but it wasn't too bad. You can tell they are short staffed in some areas, but there was great service in the busy places. 14 of us had the best day today!"
457,2017-5,"We spent three days at Universal with a 16 and 12 year old. We had an absolutely amazing time there, even with COVID and having to wear masks in 90 degree heat! The employees were happy, amusing and tentative. Everything was spotlessly clean. There were designated employees just continually cleaning handrails and reminding visitors to wear their masks properly. Even the vehicles were socially distanced when parking (should do that all the time! haha!!) The rides were some of the best we have been on, and the little shows around the park were great! Especially loved the drumming builders...lol. So much to see and do for everyone. Visited Finnegan's for a proper sit down meal twice, was so yummy and husband was loving the real draught Guinness. Job well done to Universal for keeping spirits high during this unprecedented time!!! Keep it up!"
458,2017-5,"We were super excited to go to the Park until we got there.  They required mask, they checked temperature, but then one of our guest was harassed for wearing a bandana instead od a mask and there was a couple right before them with a bandana. First STRIKE!!  SECOND STRIKE! there were rides that were closed, mainly the good rides but the price of the tickets never changed.  THIRD STRIKE! As we were leaving one of the security guards, name Mike cussed my daughter bc as she was talking her mask was moving up and down showing a portion of her nose. He said in a disgusted tone-your mask should cover your nose! As we got closer she said, I was talking and my mask is moving. He said again with a tone in his voice, pull up the mask, so she stood in front of him and pulled up her mask and asked...like this? And walked away. As we were walking away he blurted out-Keep your masking on your F%&*ing face! Everyone stopped in their tracks.  We reported him to the supervisor who didn't show any concern for the matter. They will be getting a report filed."
459,2017-5,"Can i just say everything was great all the team members were very helpful few in particular stood out above the rest, Mat jorge, and lauren at wimpys were the epitomy of what it means to work for a theme park and go above and beyond my son had a bday and was having a bad time because the cart we went to was out of churros and i knew my 5 year old wasn't understanding having to wait longer. The enthusiasm the happy bday wishes and free ice cream kept him happy i will not forget the best experience ive had in any theme park i have been to. Plus its the best burger in universal if you like a nice sizeable medium burger with a bit of pink in it like i do, guess what im saying is ill be returning and toon lagoon will remain my favorite"
460,2017-5,"don't even know where to start. COVID has definitely left an ugly mark on the tourism industry. Universal Studios has so many enjoyable things to do. The employees work hard to keep things clean and give hand sanitizer to each person before going on a ride. There are marks on the floors where you wait for rides in order to encourage social distancing. Those are reasonable steps. But masks are required not only inside buildings, which might be a bit understandable, but outside in the Florida heat and humidity at all times. Maybe that would be necessary if we were packed like sardines and walking down every street thought the park. But that wasn't the case. We were outside, sticking together as a family group, avoiding being around other people, and STILL employees would ask us to pull our masks up or make sure they are over our noses. Outside. In the sun. By ourselves. It was ridiculous. They felt like mask Nazis. The announcements to wear masks were over the loud speaker. Employees were walking around with signs saying to wear a mask. It was hot and hard to breathe but unless you were actively eating or drinking, masks had to be on and up. Made for a truly miserable experience. Thankfully we won this trip to Universal Studios. We will NEVER come back until these ridiculous rules are ended!"
461,2017-5,We stopped here and got some Dippin Dots and relaxed and watch the people walk by. Watch the boats on the canal and listen to the music.
462,2017-5,"We had planned to come in March right as everything started shutting down. We canceled, attempted to go in June and canceled again. Finally we were able to come! They did a great job with social distancing. Not gonna lie, wearing a mask in 90 degree weather sucked but totally understand and better safe than sorry. I had read that the crowd level was predicted to be 4/10. Felt a lot busier, hour wait on rides and places to eat. I love that most of the lines were out of the sun and had air condition making it much cooler. Family favorites were the Butterbeer, Transformers, Harry Potter and The Mummy. The Mummy was so much more fast and scary than I was expecting! My husband and son did The Rip Ride Rockit too(it surprisingly had a short wait all day). We would definitely come back! Did not do all the rides but the ones we did were amazing."
463,2017-5,"We live in Central Florida and go to Universal once or twice a year. Today's visit was the worst we have ever had and I won't be going back any time soon.  The crowds were much bigger than I expected, especially for midweek, and the ride lines were extremely long. The popular rides were 90 to 120 minutes and the others were an hour plus or minus. I'm guessing that the lines were a result of the large crowds and the reduced ride capacity due to COVID restrictions.  More annoying than just the long lines was our experience on the Haggard ride. We had never been on it and it was the primary target of this trip. We arrived right at public opening time of 10am and the Haggard wait time was already 120 minutes. We got in line and moved along for an hour and fifteen minutes when they announce the ride was in a ""temporary delay"" due to technical issues. Expecting the delay to be short and not wanting to waste our wait, we waited for the next hour, along with thousands of others, until they finally announce the ride was closed for the day. I can't believe that they couldn't do a better job of managing the ride and wasting 2 hours and 15 minutes of our day at their park. Throughout the day I noticed on the Universal app that several other rides were closed at various time of the day.  One positive was that despite the large number of people, most people were social distancing and kept their masks on. I never really felt unsafe."
464,2017-5,"My boyfriend and I are both handicapped and require wheel chairs. We were so disappointed that most of the rides do not allow you to ride your wheel chair to the ride but instead you must use a hand operated wheel chair, which I wasn't able to do as I have no arm strength. Workers were not allowed to push us to the ride so we weren't able to enjoy the rides. There were quite a few rides, restaurants and shops that were closed. The park wasn't crowded at all and I noticed that most rides were around an hour or less wait. The busiest part of the park was the Harry Potter area and that was very enjoyable! Everyone was very good about wearing masks and there were plenty of area's to wash your hands or use sanitizer. Several of the rides have restricted seating size, so if you're over weight by much you can't fit into the seats. They have sample seats outside the rides but I was too embarrassed to try one out with others watching. I felt that charging $25 PLUS TAX to park was ridiculous considering the cost of a days' ticket! In conclusion, at the age of 64, handicapped and overweight, our theme park days are over with and better left to young, healthy and weight appropriate people. I'm glad I enjoyed them in my younger years."
465,2017-5,"We have spent several days at Disney Parks and decided to venture to Universal Studios CityWalk for dinner despite what we had read online about lack of safety procedures. Here is the truth: universal studios definitely attracts a lower class of people who have utter disregard for others. For every 5 people we saw there was either a person or group without a face covering or had their face covering under their nose or under their chin. They all were constantly in movement and not stationary while eating or drinking. No one follows physical distancing guidelines.  Security guards constantly passed pwople without masks on and ignored them. We saw many security guards gathered in groups completwlt ignoring what was going on around them.  We had a great experience outside on the patio at Margaritaville. Once actually seated (not while in line) they take a pandemic seriously.  Needless to say - the reviews we read were generous. If you take your health seriously at all and actually care about the possibility that you could be carrying something that could hurt others, do NOT go to Univeral Florida! After 1 short evening at CityWalk we will NOT be buying tickets to this theme park until long after the pandemic is over. Sad as this was one of our favorite places to visit.  If you want to get out safely, go to Disney. Step it up Universal - this is extremely unresponsible."
466,2017-5,"I have planned some fantastic, fabulous vacations in my time. I like to do things myself because, frankly, I don't trust others. I HATE having to always find someone to ask. I feel like I'm wasting my time. This vacation was the lowest of the low for us. It was the most frustrating and disappointing vacation we have ever taken!  First, the good. The staff is phenomenal! Almost everyone we talked to was super helpful and friendly. The staff at the hotel (Lowes Royal Pacific) was the absolute best people to work with! We drove 15 hours to get there and arrived late Sunday night. We checked into our room at 10:30, unpacked, relaxed a few minutes, and went to bed. Thankfully I was the only one who noticed the toilet tank emptying and refilling every 30 minutes, but it kept me up all night long. I wrote to the hotel staff (they use text messaging as well as calls) and they had someone in to look at it within 20 minutes. The gentleman worked on it and left. This caused the toilet to do this every 5-8 minutes, so I wrote back. Same guy came back and said he had a few more pieces he could replace, but wasn't sure what was causing it. We went to the pool while he finished working. I got back in the room and found it was now doing this every 45 seconds! Writing again the gal asked if I'd like to change rooms. It was 9:30 PM and I said only if it was close by, as we had unpacked. She found us a room down the hall and we were moved in an hour. She, by no prompt from me, comped the parking fee (more on this later) ($125) for the inconvenience. Wonderful customer service!  I also want to point out specifically the staff in Volcano Bay. They are phenomenal and I highly recommend getting a cabana if you are going to be there all day. We had excellent service and their set-up is fantastic! Our lunch was brought to us and we had a personal attendant who made sure we always had towels and water. You also get a fruit/pastry basket, which was really nice.  The rides are all pretty fun. We rode almost every ride, the only 2 being the one we were not allowed to (Pteranadon Flyers), Popeye's Raging Rapids (a water ride and we didn't want to get wet), and the one that wasn't open when we got there (Woody Woodpecker). Most of their rides are very derivative of all the others. They are mostly 3D/4D with lots of spinning motion. Not a lot of variety on type of ride, but each ride has its own theme and more were pretty cool once. Hagrid's Motorbike ride was extremely enjoyable and innovative! It is one of the few rides anywhere worth the wait in line.  Now to the bad points. Do NOT under any circumstances purchase a vacation package unless you are prepared to not get what you paid for. We purchased this package in February. What we were told we were getting was an hour early park admission to Harry Potter Land and Volcano Bay. I looked at the website and everything indicated that it was an hour early into BOTH Harry Potter parks. We get there and I was told we are only getting an hour into Island of Adventure Harry Potter and Universal Studios Harry Potter is only an hour early on weekends. (What!?!) Plus, the hour early into Islands coincides with the opening time of Universal, so you actually lose an hour in that park if you want to try to get on Hagrid's Magical Motorbike (the only ride without fast pass capabilities) early as the line gets really long. Not only that, we went to Islands and Universal for 3 days and 2 of those days Hagrid's was delayed for an hour or more during early admission, so actually getting in early had no benefit what-so-ever.  The other thing that is on my ticket email that we purchased was an hour early in Volcano Bay. When we got there we were informed that we only got 30 minutes early. As far as I am concerned, this is illegal as we purchased something from them and they did not give it to us. I called their customer service to complain and he said, ""we are unfortunately unable to open Volcano Bay just for you."" I told him I wasn't calling for that. I want part of my money refunded as they sold me something they had no intention of providing! He was very condescending as he told me he understood how I felt, but he could do nothing. I was on the phone with him for 15-ish minutes to just have him be condescending and very unhelpful. I gave up and tried to enjoy my day.  When we purchased this package there was a clause about a possible parking fee, but nothing more than that. No number to check and no indication that people actually staying in the hotel will be charged a fee. I honestly thought if you didn't stay in a hotel you were charged, but if you did stay you were not. I get there to find out there is a $20+ a night charge and it will be another $125 for us to stay there. Why couldn't they just put that on the package online? It is extremely expensive to do this and after driving 15 hours, we aren't going to say never mind, we want a refund. I feel this is dishonest on Universal's part. They hide fees and know you'll pay them anyway when you get there. Yes, ours was taken off our bill, but that was because our room had a problem. It still seems unethical.  My last complaint was that we showed up for the early admission wanting breakfast at the Three Broomsticks, because their menu has a breakfast section. None of us ate due to this. We get there and it's not open. I ask a vendor on the ""street"" about it and she tells me breakfast is suspended at this time. There was no indication of that anywhere online or on their app (which everyone says to use)! I realize the app says to check times, but I would never have guessed they would up and decide not to serve breakfast at all. We had to wait until 10AM to get out of the Harry Potter part to find something to feed my children. I acknowledge that this is partly my fault, as I did not ask anyone and I should have, but like I said before, I hate not being able to plan vacations all by myself! There is no reason their app could not have been updated to indicate this or that an email couldn't have been sent to me saying all these changes they had made. The technology is out there.  The other technology flaw they have is for eating in restaurants in park. They want you to link a credit card to the app on your phone to order and pay that way. We do not link our credit cards or any banking information to our phones for privacy reasons and in case they were to get lost or stolen. Plus, we used gift cards to help control how much we spent. We went to eat at the Leaky Cauldron and sat for 10 minutes with no one coming to our table. I got up to go ask, as I knew I had to go to the register to order. I was told to go back to the table and do it on the app. I had to explain over and over again at every restaurant we ate that we were not doing that and I needed to go to the register. Most places were cool with it, but the Leaky Cauldron servers acted like I was crazy. It was frustrating to have to explain to everyone working what we needed as they pushed the pay by app on us everywhere we went.  We will never go back and my suggestion to anyone reading this is to not buy a vacation package or be prepared to be disappointed. Stay off site and buy tickets because you aren't going to get what Universal sells to you once you get there. Their customer service number is pointless, they use false advertising, and their technology is very unhelpful. I really wish I could say we got more out of this for what we paid. It was super frustrating and not very restful for the adults dealing with it all. Yes, I've been to Disney and they know how to take care of you so you have no worries and we got everything we paid for!"
467,2017-5,Even though Florida lifted restrictions. Universal did not. Mask at all times even outside in 90 degree weather They hassle you if it’s not over your nose. Lines r long from not filling rides. Most restaurants r closed so it takes hour for food. Good luck if you wanna eat inside in air conditioning. Website aside they closed at 9 but they closed at 7. I won’t be back as long as they’re trying to be politically correct!!!!
468,2017-5,My husband & I visit Universal every year. This year we were excited as we've purchased tickets in advance and planned to both have the day off. but we don't have a smart phone. Without a smartphone there are issues eating in the restaurants and going on ride because we are unable to virtual cue anything. Tried to ask this question on your website but there is no link to e-mail. We always have a super time visiting Universal Studios. This year was a disappointment. Next time we will consider spending our money somewhere else. Thanks for nothing.
469,2017-5,Get to Hogsmead and Three Broomstick early and I highly recommend the Fast pass will save a long of time in line
470,2017-6,"Without the fast pass don’t plan on riding any of the premier rides. We went yesterday and were only able to ride one ride. Plan on around $400 per person if you are not staying at a universal hotel. Go ahead and get the fast pass if you want to ride. If you just want to go play and enjoy the park you don’t need one.  Instead of requiring fast passes to do anything, why don’t you just start charging people $400 each and limit the number of people you allow in so everyone can enjoy? That way people can budget and be prepared?  I will remember this next time for sure and get fast passes ahead of time."
471,2017-6,It was a great experience with 5 teenagers on a birthday trip. The lines weren't too long and food lines were moving as well. Lots of areas to tests and take masks off and lot of sanitizing
472,2017-6,"Comparing to LA Universal - this one is close to nothing. 1. Ticket is either one of the parks, if you pick one the other is not letting you in. 2. Minions virtual line never has any spots 3. Lines for food 4. Realistic picture: It is just narrows down to three shows during the day and is was $700 for four people. $700 for three tiny 12-min shows and multiple hours in lines.  Totally regret"
473,2017-6,"Below is an email that i wrote to the guest services of universal and am sharing with you:  I must tell you about an experience at your park today that has been completely mishandled and is the single reason our family will not be purchasing the remaining 4 annual passes we planned to and may never visit again. My mother and son visited yestersay with their annual passes and endured the day of standing in line regularly, as my mother is a proud person. However, I had made sure she had all the paperwork for her disability. Including her handicap plaque and doctors information regarding her degenerative joint disease. Extended periods of walking and standing causes joint swelling to the point of not being able to walk. This morning, I advised her to put her pride aside and go speak to guest services regarding an assistance pass. She did and was advised to get a wheelchair instead. She was embarrassed and crying so when they offered her a manual wheelchair, she took it and was unable to even use it, so instead a women with an aleady debilitating disease was pushing around her own wheelchair. This is unacceptable. I called guest services after they had been in line for over an hour for one ride because my mom was crying in pain and i wanted to know how to advise her to get the assistance she needed. The guest service person told me since she had been standinh in line for over an hour, it was obvious she could stand in line qnd they accommodated her as much as they could. He then asked me to explain why it was medically an issue, which goes against the hiipa laws and i explained it. He said she would need to go to guest services and explain it and if they could do anything, they would decide. I asked to speak with a supervisor bc after almost 5 hours in the park, they want to leave and i wanted to assist them any way I could by perhaps granting them a few express passes so their last day was somewhat salvageable. Since they are annual pass holders, my mom was saying she did not believe they would ever return and I also wanted to discuss if we could reverse their pass to a 2 day pass and be done with universal. We gave up our Disney passes for all 6 of our family members bc we felt we were at the age with the kids to enjoy universal , but are now very sure we made a huge mistake and I needed to discuss this with them. Her plan is to leave the park asap and never come back, but I have asked her to stop at guest services to try and speak with a manager . She stated she is humiliated enough already and I am 3 hours away and can not do anything. I felt it was important that someone understand exactly what happened, and I will be posting this everywhere I can bc anyone whose family suffers needs to know this story and be aware . I was also told via guest services that there is no sort of disability pass bc ppl have different disabilities and each person would have to explain theirs (which my mother did and provided proof"
474,2017-6,"I’ve been an annual pass holder before- I was so disappointed this trip. Some rides are by virtual reservation only. Good luck getting one of those. They are only available on the app which just clocks until it says “check back at another time”. Not sure what the cost of my ticket paid for. The rules are insane. I was sitting in a restaurant and our table was next to the bar, yet my husband had to go outside in the sun and wait in a line outside the restaurant to just come back inside to get us a beer. They wouldn’t give him mine either even though I sent my ID with him and there was a sign saying 1 drink per ID. Now as we sit eating the fries we were forced to order or leave, patrons are 3 deep in front of the same bar. It’s like employees have carte blanche here. Also, I was harassed about my mask not being on in 100 degrees while I was trying to drink one of my $5 waters. It used to be so fun to come here. What a revelation."
475,2017-6,"Everything was wonderfull. Great service, bathrooms clean, 5 star atractions. Great food and restaurants."
476,2017-6,They turn you in circles from trying to park to walking to the entrance to waste time to finally tell you they are at capacity. We got rerouted for parking then walked about 15 mins to get to the gate after temp checks and security.  They oversold tickets for the day to let you know that they are at capacity after you finally reach the gate despite the ticket you purchased. We arrived at 11am because we figured we would stay until closing.  Really disappointed with UNIVERSAL ORLANDO. Way to disappoint excited children.  Instead of waiting hours for a maybe ticket that we realized we purchased we fought for a refund that was not nearly what we spent for our original tickets after jumping through so many hoops and talking to multiple associates that told us something different. Regardless we are so glad we didn’t stand there for hours in 90 degree weather for a maybe ticket. We left and made the best of the rest of our day.
477,2017-6,"Don't bother unless you buy the express pass. Not only do you get to ride in 1/4 of the time of peasants with normal tickets, express lines can be packed toe-to-toe. You can buy your way out of the pandemic spacing imposed on peons."
478,2017-6,"Cast team was fabulous, everything was great. I can't wait to go again. The best park at orlando. Yujuuu"
479,2017-6,"The magic was gone with all of their restrictions. Certain attractions were closed almost no characters walking around and interacting with the kids. Better to wait until worth full price. It’s a scam I felt cheated out of my money.full park price is not worth it.Face painting is still full 15$ price for half the face when it should be whole face. Also the new policy of keeping masks on during your ENTIRE stay in the hot Florida heat was very very difficult. They do have rest areas where you can take your mask off, but that didn’t make the experience better. The entire time we were there we were being harassed by employees about the masks. You can be 10 ft away from someone or no one around at all, and there will be someone to harass you about pulling your mask up. It took away from what could have been a waaaay better experience. My husband was playing and talking but with our daughter and they told him to not lower his mask. He flipped out because he was enjoying the moment counting owls in the Harry Potter side of park with our 2 year old and the moment was ruined. Felt like we were in jail or school. Definitely won’t be coming back until restrictions are lifted."
480,2017-6,"Universal is a fun place for people of all ages. They have plenty of things to do like ride rides, attend shows, and eat. They have so many good restaurants in the parks and in City Walk. One of my favourites is the Chocolate Emporium where they have amazing specialty milkshakes. It gets very crowded in the summer and around holidays so i would suggest staying in a Universal Resort that offers fast passes. I have stayed in the Portofino, Royal Pacific, and Hardrock all of which have beautiful scenery and a wonderful staff. The resorts offer a ferry boat ride to the parks or you can use the short walking trails. If you don't want to stay at a Universal Resort another option to cut down wait times is to use the single rider line. It's great if you don't mind being separated from your party. It was overall a wonderful experience and I will definitely be back!"
481,2017-6,"The park did a decent job of reopening for Covid. There is social distancing, temperature checks, hand sanitizing stations, and masks are required. At some points, there were large crowds, especially when the park closed, so I recommend leaving 30 minutes before the park actually closes. The virtual lines worked very well and I never felt uncomfortable in a line with too many people. The new deals Universal is offering are amazing and I plan on going back a few more times this year. The new Harry Potter ride is amazing!"
482,2017-6,"There were many rides to go on and with the fast pass I was able to do many rides over the curse of the day. I loved going to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter as I felt it was a good representation of the movies/books and was very cool to see. The lines however can be long sometimes and the food is expensive. I feel as though it's worth it for the memories you make and the overall experiences you gain from this park. I think it is very worth it, to visit and travel here and you will not regret your decision."
483,2017-6,"Universal Studios is a very fun and entertaining place to visit! It is full of rollercoasters and plenty of rides. Not to mention that it includes great, delicious food around the whole park. This is a very exciting place to go filled with lots of adventures. I would definitely recommend others to go and have a blast creating countless memories!"
484,2017-6,the park is taking great measures with covid but the virtual lines are a disaster had to complain to guest services in order to be able to ride several rides otherwise becuase of their system we would of missed most of it
485,2017-6,"This was our first theme park visit since the pandemic started so we were not sure what to expect. When parking, every other parking space was blocked off to allow social distancing. Masks were required, except when eating. The few traditional waiting lines had distance markings on the floor. Parades and street shows were not present. Some photo with characters were allowed but only with the visitor a few feet in front of the characters. The biggest change however was with most wait lines that were converted to virtual: You use your app to reserve a future time, saving you from waiting in long lines. This sounded great except that it didn’t work at all for us! We arrived a little after noon and by that time there were zero time slots available! We were wondering why would they let people in the park if they cannot get on any of the rides? Talking to Universal team members, we were told to check the app as they would release time slots every hour. That did NOT happen. Actually it did a few hours later but the app froze and didn’t allow us to reserve the slots it briefly displayed. This repeated a few times and we suspected the system just wasn’t working. That could have totally ruined our experience, but we were saved by the friendly Universal team members. When we explained the issue and showed them screen shots of time slots we attempted but failed to secure, they actually allowed us to use these time slots as if we were able to capture them! This allowed us to go on the Mummy, Jimmy Fallon, and Harry Potter. We also stood in the traditional lines for the Simpsons and Men In Black. So these 5 rides plus walking around the park, shopping at the Hello Kitty store, and getting Butter Bear ice cream made the trip worthwhile. One other issue: I wear eye glasses and it was raining lightly the entire day Saturday. Most of the rides require 3-D glasses. These didn’t work well for me as they kept slipping off (maybe due to sanitizer used before handing them to you). Even worse, with the mask on, my eye glasses got fogged up very quickly and so it was hard to see the 3-D show! Still I did enjoy it and the rest of my family that don’t wear glasses didn’t have this issue. Big thanks to the awesome Universal staff for doing everything they can to create a safe and pleasant experience for their guests despite the difficult circumstances."
486,2017-6,"We actually went in Aug-2019 during summer break to Universal Studios Florida. It was well planned tour by my 13 year old son and he made all reservations, day wise plan for each places to tour at Florida. We really enjoyed the time with fun and joy. Couple of rides were really different than what we enjoyed in past. All together our experience with the accommodation that we booked in their resort was not at all good. We recommend to avail better options available in Hotels there. It will be good, comfortable selection by all means including cost."
487,2017-6,"Special effects we loved this visit, our children had already discovered it through the comments read on the internet, they each made a list with their visit preferences, it was magical"
488,2017-6,"The staff working here makes this theme park amazing!! Best theme park employees ever. So nice and helpful. My husband and I (just got married two weeks ago)! went to Universal Studios Florida & Islands is Adventure for the first time ever today (Sept 30). We had the absolute best time. Covid precautions were handled wonderfully with everyone wearing their masks, temperature checks before check in and sanitizer before every ride. Tons of spacing and social distancing on every attraction. We felt totally safe and comfortable and we have been very cautious about Covid for this entire pandemic. I am a huge Harry Potter Superfan and we have spent some time out in the California HP world and universal studios park. Always love it and have a great time but Florida tops it by a mile due to having not just Hogsmeade but also the Diagon Alley world! We went to Ollivanders wand shop in Diagon Alley because I have always wanted to partake in the “wand chooses the wizard” experience/show. In LA pre-Covid, lines were hours long for this attraction and fast passes were not used towards it, so I have never done this experience but always wanted to. We spoke with a lovely girl working in Ollivanders Diagon Alley named Jessica who showed us how to get to the back of the shop where the wand experience sign ups were. I’m not sure if Orlando always does this Or if it is due to Covid, but they were signing people up to reserve times for later in the day. We were thrilled that times were still available and we didn’t have to wait in a 5 hour line to have the experience! Taylor was doing the wand experience sign ups - she was super nice and even fit us in at a wand appointment that was a perfect time for us (12 noon)! She was so helpful and great.  We were really excited about our wand appointment, and since we had a reservation time, we could actually walk around the park for a bit and then come back to our wand appointment. I was absolutely shocked when they brought just myself and my husband inside!! Because of Covid they were only doing one family/group at a time. I couldn’t believe it. I had to try not to cry in public, I was so thrilled, lol. They brought us inside by ourselves and I was able to do the wand experience - something I’ve always dreamed of doing. I felt just like Harry in the book/movie. It was a really wonderful once in a lifetime opportunity that I am so grateful to Taylor, Jessica and the whole team for. At the end, I of course bought my wand, and Jessica happened to be the sales clerk! She mentioned the wand holder and the masks for sale and I bought them also. Their team made the day one I will never forget for sure.  We also grabbed a fire whiskey/cider combination from Janessa who made an excellent drink and was very friendly as well, and a butterbeer ice cream from Fortescue’s which was great.  Then we took the Hogwarts Express over to the Islands park. Wow! Looks just like the movie. Because of Covid, each family/group once again, gets their own compartment on the train!!! Such a a cool experience. Again, because of Covid it you got your own space heading over to the next park, which was pretty awesome, and the experience was wonderful.  My husband and I also went on the Hagrids Motorbike ride at the very end of the day. Though we bought the fast pass, that didn’t work towards Hagrid’s (we were told it is because it is too new of a ride). We got in line one minute of 6pm (park closure) and the line said it would be a 90 min wait - but we only waited 30 min! We both agreed it was the best ride we have ever been on (and he’s been on a ton of roller coasters). Completely worth the wait. Super exciting and with Hagrid and the other creature animatronics there it was a very creative and fun ride. Even my husband, who isn’t nearly as big a Potter fan as me, loved it and thought it was very thrilling.  I would highly recommend anyone who is interested in checking out a theme park right now to go to Universal & Islands, and any Harry Potter fans should absolutely go now! In fact, we had so much fun that we are hopefully taking my parents to the park and going again this week!"
489,2017-6,"We paid over 2 thousand dollars for our tickets (FULL PRICE) and everything but the rides and the outside hot dog stands were closed. They should be offering discounts not charging full price. The rides were great, especially Harry Potter world. They did a good job of making sure everyone had their masks on properly and stood six feet apart but that full price thing has turned me off of Disney forever."
490,2017-6,"i was so existing to had the experience of all universal movies games such as transformers , minions , fast & furious i had the rollers coaster journey takes a great photos there are a variety of restaurants hope to take my kids there oneday"
491,2017-7,"It has become a premium park with their additional Express Pass that they want you to buy. They now have several rides that are only available through their virtual que system. If you buy the additional Express Pass you will have no problems reserving a spot on the virtual que. with just a general admission ticket, we couldn’t get a virtual pass. They release them at specific times, you click on the App to reserve a virtual pass, it spins for 1-2 minutes and tells you they are all out of passes on the virtual que. At that point it’s too late to try for a different virtual que, all of them go in seconds upon release. We tried 3 times the same day at the designated times and got zero virtual passes. About 1/3rd of the rides are off limits with general admission alone. No standby line for those virtual que rides. It was the worst visit I have ever had. It wasn’t worth visiting. 1 Star is too generous."
492,2017-7,"I knew there would be COVID precautions and I was a little worried after reading the negative reviews and customer complaints. Social distancing is handled very effectively by the park. I was amazed that they were able to accomplish keeping people 6 feet apart even in the serpentine lines. The drawback to the social distancing lines equated to longer lines. However, the ride experience itself was better. for instance on MIB. The wait would have been 5 minutes. But now due to social distancing its 15. But after a 15 minute wait my wife and I were place in our own car. This in my opinion makes the wait worthwhile. I even bought the ride photo. And it was pretty much the same throughout the park. To sum it up. Go to the park be patient and relaxed and have loads if fun."
493,2017-7,"The parks seem more crowded than Disney World parks. Though guest were required to ware masks, many were not worn properly."
494,2017-7,"Without a doubt, it is the activity that we preferred for the special effects, it feels like reality, it was magic"
495,2017-7,"Harry Potter area was spectacular. Truly spectacular.  Some of the other rides were great.  Some of the rides haven't seen a coat of paint in 15 years.  We are, admittedly, Disney fans and are used to the constant improvement of Disney parks and technology. Universal really went all out on Harry Potter portions, but some of the older rides and areas needs TLC.  The app has clunky parts. The photo package is totally bizarre compared to Disney. Pictures are manually added, you have to get a print out slip at Will Call to then turn around and activate it in the park to get a necklace, and then every picture is manually added. And the pictures don't even show up in the Universal app! We still have some that were taken and not added.  We did the Express Pass--which was super helpful on a few rides, kind of helpful on most rides, and useless on some rides (because their was no line--MIB and ET, for example). It also excludes Hagrid's Motorbike (which we didn't know until we tried to get in line).  Kids loved, loved the interactive wands--especially in Diagon Alley.  Also weird--all adults needed ID with their tickets to get into the park. This wasn't disclosed anywhere in advance (or was done so small we didn't see it). Fortunately, we all had it, but it could have been a problem.  Do we wish they would improve some of the customer service pressure points? Yes!  Would we still go again (and spend most of our time in the Harry Potter portions? Yes!  They were less stringent about COVID restrictions, which was fine with us. Lots of spacing in rides and restaurants--virtually no enforced restrictions in any of the stores. Hand sanitized before every ride."
496,2017-7,"temp checks, and social distancing practiced.Harry potter area amazing, try the butter beer frozen. The attraction wait times were all about 15-20 minutes max Great time had by all"
497,2017-7,"This is the first time I have gone to universal since COVID happened and I am pretty shocked how well they are handling things at the park. From cleaning the rides everytime someone gets off, to giving you hand sanitizer before you get on and once you get off, and even making sure while waiting in line everyone is 6+ feet from each other enforcing social distancing. The park was pretty empty when my boyfriend and I went and lines we’re no more than 10-15 minutes. (:"
498,2017-7,"Fantastic fun for all ages, and very impressed with their COVID precautions. There's not single ride my family didn't enjoy, and food stands were generous with free ice water in the hot sun. Harry Potter area workers especially helpful with amusing children. Afterward, got in touch to buy souvenirs from stores that were closed when we left and person on phone was very helpful. Expensive, but you get what you paid for. Don't miss the Monster Makeup show!"
499,2017-7,I visited Universal last weekend and it was amazing. Limited capacity and extra cleaning made it a great trip. I felt extremely comfortable with the way they handled each guest and each ride. Hand sanitizer was mandatory before getting on any ride and was available after each ride. They also limited the rides to each group so you aren’t sitting with strangers. Definitely worth the money to go while it’s slow.
500,2017-7,"We went to Universal during the peak of the COVID surge, a few weeks after it re-opened in June. We had a wonderful time. Mask wearing was enforced and there was hand sanitizer everywhere. Especially enjoyed the Harry Potter rides and Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure is incredible and worth waiting for. Lines were short and we were able to rush through both Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure in a day (rushed through, mostly Harry Potter). Hogwarts Express is a must-ride and there were plenty of other fun rides. Parts of Universal feel dated and need to be revamped (Superhero rides, Dr. Seuss section). Some staff members are wonderful, others are just ok as to helpfulness and willingness to answer questions. There was more mask difficulty at CityWalk where staff members were telling people to wear masks properly but were being ignored by guests. Overall, we loved our trip though we can't imagine what it would be like when it was busy and we would have to wait in long lines."
501,2017-7,"Wizarding World of Harry Potter is amazing. The detail, shops, staff. Do everything you can rides, shops, interactive wands. Simpsons, Minions, MIB.. Transformers is the best 4D experience, and is a must do. I suggest if you have kids 10 and under rent a stroller."
502,2017-7,"We came on a holiday before here and it was amazing and this time over it was pretty much the same with some new rides, all of the facilities were great and all the staff were helpful if we got lost overall it was a great holiday away"
503,2017-7,"They really take safety seriously, every single attraction is packed with hand sanitizer and someone that makes sure every person gets it. Keeping social distance is priority on the rides and the park in general is super clean, including restrooms. The staff is very kind and professional since you step into the park. Thank you for such a nice attitude that keeps people coming back."
504,2017-7,"Spent a great weekend at Universal. Initially had a problem getting into the park because of a ticket issue that we caused, but Donnie at the front gate helped us correct our mistake. The staff is on top of the mask wearing by reminding people politely and they are good at keeping the recommended spacing in lines. Then to top it all off, we lost our car keys and Universal arranged for a cab to get us back to the hotel. I figured it would be another $75+ or so but to our surprise, Universal picked up the tab for the cab. Thank you Maria at Guest Services. I cannot say enough about the staff at the park. I've been in the past but it really feels like they're going way above and beyond. I will definitely be back."
505,2017-7,"Best day this year so far! We went yesterday, 9/6/2020. I took my 14 year old son, 6 year old daughter, and 3 year old son. This was their first time. We all had an equally great time. My little guy even got to ride 10 rides which I didn’t think was possible at Universal Studios, and loved every one especially Harry Potter. All my kids in unison said it’s way better than Disney! Posted wait times were overstated. We never waited for any ride for more than 25 minutes and it goes by so fast. One of my concerns was that we would not be able to ride the Harry Potter ride which was part of the Virtual Line rides, and we didn’t have express passes. I kept checking throughout the day for times to return to no avail. I already gave up on riding it, and was really disappointed, and we were getting ready to leave when they opened up the stand by queue!!! I was SO HAPPY even though the wait was close to 2 hours long. I didn’t care. I was sure it was worth it. However we didn’t have to wait even 5 minutes because we were one of the lucky few that got pulled out of the line by a Harry Potter angel named MIRANDA and taken right up to the ride by a “secret passage” with an elevator, and when we got to the boarding area we were the first and only ones there and at my daughters request got to ride in the first row! I cannot in words describe the gratitude I felt and actually cried after we got off the ride because I was so touched by Miranda’s actions and her interactions with my kids. She said she’s taking us a secret way because my 3 year old had the cutest mask on and kept it on the whole time with no complaints. I will forever be grateful for this experience that not only made my whole day, but our whole trip! Because of this we still had time to ride the minions ride and shop at gift shops. The only reason for 4 stars is because our dining experience was less than perfect. We got to the Krusty Burger at 2pm and did not get our food until 3:43pm. And that was after sitting down at our assigned table with a number for over 20 minutes, at which point I had to ask an associate more than once to please check on our order which was placed over and hour ago. With 2 young kids that act like they haven’t eaten in months, while watching everyone around them eat, it was not a pleasant and relaxing lunch that I anticipated. Other than, 5 stars all the way!! I am now seriously considering season passes as we live in Palm Beach County and I can totally see coming here at least once a month, and definitely for special events."
506,2017-7,"Our day was practically ruined!!! So we go into universal studios and it was all fine but then we find out that there is a thing called virtual line which Is for like all of the good rides, and we were ok ok we just have to make a reservation that’s all. NO let me explain how it works. Basically you have to make a time reservation for the ride you want to go on but when we tried making the reservation but there were non available and when there finally was I clicked it super fast and it said oh sorry another person already booked it and it says that every tine so we couldn’t go on any rides in universal studios but I do recommend islands of adventure there is no virtual line for anything and is waaaay funner for kids😄"
507,2017-7,"We just returned from a stay at Royal Pacific with a 4 day park to park ticket option. We enjoyed our stay at Royal Pacific but this review will specifically be for the parks only.  Our stay was from 09/03-09/07. We went in knowing that our stay would include a weekend and a holiday weekend at that. We anticipated larger crowds but we were expecting some better precautions in place in regards to managing crowds.  Once the parks hit capacity for the day it was apparent that there were just too many people in the parks. I understand that the parks are following state guidelines but capacity limits need to be reevaluated. It was especially difficult to distance ourselves from other groups in Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade and as a whole, Islands of Adventure. It was apparent that staff were extremely overwhelmed by the crowds and were having a difficult time managing everybody. There was also just no way to maintain 6 feet away from the party ahead of you or behind you in certain areas of the park and in certain queues once they extended past where the floor markings were. It would have been helpful if there were team members stationed throughout the queues monitoring guests and separating as needed.  Again, we truly did anticipate and prepared ourselves for dealing with higher than average crowds due to the weekend and Labor Day, but we were surprised by the capacity allowed in the parks right now, especially if it can't be managed appropriately.  With that said, we still had a wonderful time but would definitely advise those who are traveling to Universal right now to avoid the weekend if at all possible."
508,2017-7,"our 1st family vacation in 6 yrs. Had a great time, just a few problems that came up. Parks opened up at different times. Our early entry pass was basically no ggod because the rides didnt open up until 2 hrs after the park. The transformers oicture was not delivered to our hotel as promised, and we still havent gotten it. Said they would mail it. Watch your charges on the hotel bill. We stayed at Lowes Royal Pacific. Although it is a wonderful hotel and the staff was great, they overcharged, and duplicate charged us. Our bill totaled 531.61, even gave us a credit back, on paper. When I chececked my account it was double chared and for more than the bill, by 131.40. I cant get zhold of anyone in accounting because of the holiday so my money, 760.00 is sitting there and I cant use it. Took me a year to save up for this vacation, aand they want to do this to me."
509,2017-7,"Booked our trip to Universal in late July for Memorial Day Weekend. We knew there where limited spaces etc so we wanted to be sure to reserve our space. If the park was operating at partial capacity I hate to see what it looks like at full capacity. We waited 2 hours to go 1.5 miles into the parking lot. Once inside it’s very confusing of which way to go to get to what resort. Finally found our way over to Universal Island of Adventure. Went to Kiosk and entered code for Will Call tickets, printed and proceeded to gate. Scan tickets “Voided tickets must go to Guest Services”. 35 minute wait at guest services, reprinted tickets and off to the island we went. Ride one ride with Xpress pass and head to next...”Sorry, this Xpress pass is for Universal Studios, you must got back to guest services”. 45 minute wait at guest services ticket reprinted and off to ride another ride... “Sorry, weather in the area no rides can operate”. Wait another 45 minutes to pass ride a few rides and then go to next ride and it doesn’t except Xpress Pass and no Virtual Line availability. Constant strike after strike. Our day for 2 was $528.00 for 2 tickets and 2 Xpress Passes. We rode 5 rides and called it a day as the place was packed, their is construction everywhere, the place is filthy, the staff walks around in regular clothes just to harass people in between drinks of water or bites of food to put their mask back on. The rides are mediocre at best. Nothing gives you a big “wow” factor. I have been to Universal Studios side before and it was much better and seemed cleaner and more friendly. City walk is great but they are renovating a giant area of it so it’s not what it normally is. Overall it wasn’t that enjoyable but the show will go on and many people will enjoy it."
510,2017-7,"Note: The trip was actually in August 2019 but was not able to select it in the drop down list. This is our family's third trip to Universal Studios Florida. I would select Good as a rating vs Very Good but the option is not available.  Areas of improvement • High cost of parks • Rides not being in operation. In the five days that we were at the parks, multiple rides were not in operation. The most frustrating ride that was down that had the most impact was the Hagrid’s Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure. • Rides are closed at the first sign of inclement weather, even when there is nothing seen or if the storm is 15 miles away. This includes pools at the resorts as well and water taxis. • Standing in line many hours for the popular rides means paying for the day and going on only a few rides.  Keep doing • Parks and resort clean • Staff mostly friendly and courteous"
511,2017-7,"We visited Universal Studios in late July to celebrate our daughter's HS grad. We want to commend Universal for how safe they made us feel at the parks, hotels and on citywalk. Everyone kept their masks on, socially distanced and kept things clean. The only part I would have them improve on is the hand sanitizer they use in the parks smells very bad. Disney's hand sanitizer is like purell and adds something to it to make it smell pure or good. I think they must be using a cheap version and I would say for them to review what type they are forcing people to use as it stinks and feels terrible on your hands. We didn't stay at a hotel this time to get the free Universal Express as there were no huge lines. We rode rides multiple times and had a great day. There are places to rest if you want to take off your mask and eat/drink and I would advise to do a sit-down lunch. We ate at the Leaky Cauldron and the only part that was strange is you are seated and order at your table as they don't want lines outside otherwise everything was really good. The only other suggestion for Universal in general is stop making people use lockers on rides like Men in Black. I do like the new locker system since our last visit to get your items in/out as it was much quicker than the thumb scan but make sure you keep your park ticket with you to reopen your locker. Weekdays are less crowded than weekends if you are from out of town like us."
512,2017-8,"Painful, irritative and troublesome service from the park. Each ride is more than 60 min wait time(wait 60 min under hot sun and have a ride for 5 min) . You have to buy the full fare of the maximum priced ticket offered or else they will make sure u will leave park disappointed. We bought 4 day promotional offer at 320$ per person. And we were not able to complete atleast one park for two days. Terrible experience. Six flags would be far better cheaper and far better thrilling."
513,2017-8,I sang there with my chorus it was really fun because afterword we got to do the whole park we had so much fun with my family.
514,2017-8,"Where to start, this exceeded my expectations in every way. We decided to book a two park pass and do them both in one day, we also upgraded to fast pass which was the best thing we did as it wouldn’t have been possible to get on all the rides if not. We started off in islands of adventure and worked our way through the park and then over to universal studios. Each area was done spectacularly but the stand out area for me was the world of Harry Potter, the simulation ride in the castle was my fav ride of the whole park. I can’t wait to visit again!!!"
515,2017-8,My family had a great time at universal theme park. They make sure they clean and sanitized the rides. We will come back.
516,2017-8,"I never was able to go to universal before, one day I randomly got the Florida resident promotional pass, so I’ve been there a few times now since they have opened back up a few months ago. I see other people complaining about wearing face masks in the heat all day and blah blah blah, but considering myself and every single staff member at universal ALSO has to wear their face masks for our entire shifts (I work at Chickfila, taking orders outside) NOBODY SHOULD BE COMPLAINING! I admit when I had to first wear a mask all day at my job it was uncomfortable to get used to, but now it’s like I’m not even wearing one. GET OVER YOURSELVES. I would say “first world problems” but considering the whole world is going through this pandemic together, it just shows how spoiled Americans really are.  I must commend the amazing things universal parks are doing following CDC guidelines. I for one absolutely LOVE the social distancing stickers because I don’t have people breathing down my neck, and can be comfortable while waiting in line.  Speaking of lines, if you go on a weekday, they are nowhere near as busy as weekends. So feel free to come during the week if you want to complain about wait times, or fork it over for the fast pass. You cannot blame the park for wait times, if the park is busy.  I honestly have been about 5 times and will most likely go again tmrw, because I am absolutely loving every single experience I have had so far. All the staff have been so friendly and inviting, and I am actually really glad that ALL the staff is being so serious about everyone wearing face masks.  Thank you universal, I really appreciate your effort and each time I’ve gone it’s been so much fun."
517,2017-8,I took my husband for his birthday with a Florida resident promotion we had too.for Tuesday Sept 1. The parks were empty until after lunch. We only waited for the train in both directions and then it was 15 minutes in ac. I absolutely loved hagrid ride. So fun. My husband did not feel great due to the mask being so hot. But We still had a ball.  All the staff was super friendly. Yes they asked people to pull their masks up. That is their job and duty. If you cannot abide by this then wait until masks are not being mandatory. No one likes wearing them.  We did not like the butter beer and $8.50 is crazy. Parking is also expensive st $26. I know they all charge. Be prepared to walk a lot but there are so many cafes and air cond places.  We can't wait to come back.
518,2017-8,"We visited Universal on August 25 (Tuesday). We arrived around 10:00 AM. We experienced everything except the ET ride and Bourne. We stayed until 5:00. We did not have express passes. It was quite empty. If we waited, it was because we had to wait until the next show, etc. Which was never more than 20 minutes. We had been here five years ago. Nothing seemed new. We enjoyed Diagon Alley because no one was around. So easy to navigate. What we did notice is that the qualify of the virtual rides have diminished. We loved the Simpsons five years ago. Rode it many times. This time, just once. At first I just thought it was my eyes getting older :) but my teenage daughter complained that the screens were not that clear. Even the Harry Potter was blurry. We were really disappointed by this park for that reason. They need to invest in updating the graphics every few years apparently. (Spider Man was great at Islands of Adventure and that was updated recently) Jimmy Fallon was the clearest one at Universal.. We ate at The Leaky Cauldrin. It seems they want everyone to order with the app. It took us a bit of time to figure it out but it worked nicely. Butterbeer, $8 REALLY! The food there was okay. It was a nice place to cool off and have nice scenery. Wearing masks is very hard in the heat. Be aware. There were times when someone in our party felt ill due to it. The staff is great at cleaning. Great at reminders to distance. Since it was really empty, it was so easy to distance. We stayed at Surfside because it provided transportation and early entry. However, we found out that early entry is one park for a whole week. It was Universal Studios all week. So do not pay the extra if you want the extra hour until you know which park will have this when you visit. We visited Volcano Bay, amazing place without crowds on August 26. Islands of Adventure 27, 28 and no lines until later in day Friday. No need for Express tickets. Loved Islands of Adventure!! Also, there are areas where concessions are shut down. We just wanted water once and could not find a place. Loved they have lockers at each ride for free. Without crowds it was great. Could see it being annoying if you had to wait in lines to go to lockers and pick up stuff."
519,2017-8,We spend 3 days at Universal and it was amazing! First day we didn’t do the express passes but decided by the second day to do it. We were SO happy we did! Got through the rides so fast. ONLY downside is not seeing the cool stuff you see while waiting in line (mostly the Harry Potter stuff) Express passes we’re kinda expensive but well worth it for us. Universal was so detailed and fun. Very glad we went and will definitely go back!
520,2017-8,"Overall, lots of fun, but make sure you get the two-park pass and take the Hogwarts Express between the two parks. This ""ride"" is a hoot@"
521,2017-8,I love universal ! It’s just amazing 😉 The rides are out of this world and the experience is Fabulous We have been twice on two different occasions and different times of year Feb half term for uk is good as it’s quiet And queues are not too bad Food in the park is decent The security Q can be long but that’s fine!
522,2017-8,"A park with something for everyone. From nostalgic shoot-em up's in Men In Black to the Minions ride at the entrance of the park. The rides are kept in great condition and I rode many multiple times as they are that fun. The food choice is good, I would recommend a trip to Moe's Tavern in the Simpsons section of the park for a 'Flamin' Moe'. It is definitely worth getting one of the refillable freestyle bottles as the stations are all across the park and you will drink a lot of fluids due to the heat. If you have park hopper, definitely jump on the Harry Potter train to do so as its fun/interactive and the journey changes depending what park you are coming from/going to. Also recommend the purchase of the fastpasses. These work on almost all the rides except one or two and are good for the whole day. You'll normally get on around 8-10 rides if you really try per day whereas I was getting on around 20 with the fastpass."
523,2017-8,We went to eat at bubba Gump but ended up eating at margaritiville. Had a great time and voodoo donuts is amazing
524,2017-8,"So we purchased the Florida Resident Season Passes and Volcano Bay as an add on. All I can say is it's POINTLESS to go! While the lines were not very long the COVID ""precautions"" are ridiculous! For example Shrek 3D has 30 seats but they load only 7! They literally show you the seating on the entrance sign to the ride so I am NOT exaggerating... Therefore, it takes more than 4 times as long to move through the line! We arrived just after 11:00am and only managed to do Shrek 3D, Hogwarts Train to Adventure Island, Eat a quick (late lunch), and go on Jurrasic Park River Adventure - then the park was closing! 6:00pm! Most of our time was spent in line with Universal (Nazi) staff yelling at more than a few people to ""cover your nose"" as just wearing the mask was insufficient even when we were all seperated by more than 6 feet (as shown in every line with stickers on the floor). Anyway, save your money until the park fully opens otherwise I suggest just skipping it totally!!!!"
525,2017-8,"My wife and I went to Islands of Adventure and found that social distancing was largely ignored. The rides seem to be a bit better, but people can't seem to read where the social distance line is and stop piling on top of you. A couple of the rides weren't even wiped down after people exited the ride. We thought the access to the parks were supposed to be limited at this time, but that did not appear to be the case. Universal should take a hint from Disney and keep people who are drinking and eating stationary. The wait times for rides were ridiculous. You really can't get on most without a long wait unless you spend the extra money for the express pass. The Hulk coaster had an 85 minute wait 2 hours after the park opened. Hagrid's ride was a 2 hour wait. We are Florida residents and probably won't go back for a while."
526,2017-8,"Lines were fairly short and rides were easy to get on. The park was pretty much empty and the normal game attractions were empty for long periods of time. I don't think Universal needs that booth that is trying to offer time share to people in the park. Maybe they could have a booth with just a computer for people if they would like to see someone about this. I saw the people at the time share become very pushy. I understand it is sales. Right now people are just trying to keep their heads above water.  The tickets weren't good to go from theme park to Diagnon alley. So we couldn't ride any of those rides. It required another payment of $55. per adult. Don't know if kids price was cheaper. Was a real bummer.  Volcano bay. Was very pretty, but lacked signs for lockers, and the mask wearing issues was very tough. You had to have a mask to get a drink or order food in the park, but did not need it for rides. Where the heck are you supposed to keep your mask? on your lounge chair it will just blow away. The other thing is they were supposed to have cages for service animals while the people were on a ride, and they told us they could provide us one so our dogs could be safe. Why aren't there like areas to take your service dog. They are supposed to be with us? Why isn't there a place for them and their owners? Dogs would like to cool down also.  In general the parks were very good about getting water for our service dogs. The warm concrete was hard on them as we couldn't get boots prior to the trip. The dogs rode the carasol with us."
527,2017-8,"Universal << Disney  That being said, Universal is still fun and Harry Potter World is EXTREMELY good. Harry Potter World is well worth the prices of admission.  Some of the other areas in the parks are pretty outdated and will need to be changed soon otherwise people will stop going.  Another thing I noticed was that Universal struggles to create a special experience in the same way that Disney does. It definitely isn't easy to do."
528,2017-8,"A fun and enjoyable experience. About as much activity as you can cram into one day, 2 days would be better."
529,2017-8,They need to have more discounts for the tickets More bath rooms They need there bus to the park more different rides to experience
530,2017-8,"I know that universal has to do what they need to do to open and stay open, but the mask nazis are needing to take it down a notch. No more than getting through the gate at opening, I simply ask my wife whixh direction we are headed and scratched an itch on my nose. The mask came down just under my nose for no more than a second before I re-adjusted it ""correctly"" over my nose and was immediately and very rudely confronted by an employee. The rudeness of the employees at most rides on our trip was uncalled for. Some of the employees were very nice and courteous, but are outnumbered by the bad. In the 90+ degree heat the masks are already hard to deal with, but having that plus the employees attitudes is uncalled for. The hand sanitizer they require you use before each ride leaves a residue after until you wash your hands thoroughly to remove it. I DO NOT recommend attending until this ""pandemic"" is over and NO MASKS are required."
531,2017-8,"We stayed at Lowe’s Royal Pacific Hotel which is amazing. We have encountered nothing but wonderful helpful people from our hotel to our stay at the parks. Daily temperature checks, hand sanitizer before every ride and of course mask through out. We have experienced a couple of technical difficulties. For someone reason my food app works everywhere but at leaky cauldron and 3 broomsticks. But again, someone was right there to help. The photo pass has given some difficulty adding and activating but again very kind and helpful people. If you are from Louisiana like us, do yourself a favor and bring salt or Tony’s. I hope to come back soon."
532,2017-8,Good job Universal with all your hard work during this pandemic. I wasn't sure if I would feel safe coming to the parks but now I do. I would say about 75% off people were wearing their masks correctly but I would hear cast members reminding those guests that were not to cover their nose and mouth. Cast members were constantly wiping down handrails . Thank you for keeping us safe.
533,2017-9,"A few attendants ruined the overall experience for my family and I. I’m aware that masks are essential at the moment, but the nature of which they treated us was uncalled for. At one point I had been taking a sip of my bottled beverage while waiting in line and the attendant scolded me for doing so. She said that if I couldn’t keep my mask on, I’ll wouldn’t be allowed to enter the ride. I was shocked. I apologized and said I was under the impression there was a 30 second drinking rule that I had been following. She snippily replied “Well I don’t know about that, but you’ll keep it on or be removed.” I did as she said, but this is not the experience I signed up for. I understand bad days/rude customers, and how it can take a toll on someone, but this strict attitude was consistent throughout the park. Then we were approaching the line for Shrek, my dad took a sip of his water and immediately placed his mask back up, while to my left another male let his mask hang down completely, and yet she only got onto my father who was actively trying to adhere to the rules. I don’t want to cry racism, but she saw both men and chose to get onto the minority:/ Both people should be held to the same standard. There were more instances of just overall rude/wrong behavior, but for now this is all I’m going to write about. I really hope Universal goes to better lengths to ensure their customer service is up to par because as of now I am thoroughly disappointed."
534,2017-9,"Sorry to write that we had a disappointing day: 1. Crowds were horrendous. Unlike Disney which requires a reservation and therefore crowds are manageable, Universal doesn't have any limits and their current ""buy a day, get the rest of the year for free"" promotion for Floridians is packing the parks with locals. Look for 30-75 minute waits for the most popular rides 2. After ordering simple chicken sandwiches at Mel's DriveIn we waited 27 minutes only to be told that they're still not ready. We cancelled order and moved on- having wasted half an hour 3. The new ride Hagrid's Motorbike was down the entire day (Friday, 8/14) 4. Unhelpful staff. We asked how to get to the Bourne Stunt show are were told, ""that's not here, that's in California."" Wrong. 5. Not enough shade, misters, and air conditioning for 90 degree humid weather 6. Not your fault, but the 6 foot rule has made lines even longer and pushed them out into the hot humid Florida weather"
535,2017-9,Great for teenagers and adults compared to Disney. Giving 4/5 as rides were having issues all the time. But it was fun still.
536,2017-9,"We're big Disney fans and were staying on resort there, but thought we'd do two days across the Universal parks. It's easy and convenient to get a Lyft over to the parks, and we had a great day in the park. There's a good range of rides to try, but overall we always found the theming and general vibe of the park is more like a 'theme park' than to the calibre of experience at Disney. In my experience over several visits across the year, it's never worth getting the Express pass if you time you visit and rides well (or certainly it's not worth getting in advance until you see the real park crowds on that day). We enjoyed our visit and wouldn't advise anyone against going, but if you're at Disney it's a lot of money to spend in addition to take time away and I'm not sure how worth it this is. The difficulty being that the tickets only become cheaper when you buy multiple days, but there isn't enough to do in the parks to warrant more than one day per Universal park if you're hopping between."
537,2017-9,"We did the Wizarding World of Harry Potter Package July 25-28th. Found the staff to be super helpful and friendly. The face masks were a minor inconvenience but in no way interfered with the fun experience the parks offered. I felt that the safety of my family was a high priority to each member of the staff both at the parks and the Endless Summer Surfside Resort, where we stayed. Although we didn't use them enough, the You Rest Area's were a great way to relax without a mask. Due to COVID-19 the crowds were smaller and we were able to ride every ride we wanted to several times, giving my grandchildren an amazing first experience. Can't wait to return."
538,2017-9,"Social distancing, hand sanitizer, and facial covering is required for all attendees. Parking is free anytime after 6:00 P.M. Free boat ride to all guest after 8:30 P.M. Live entertainment, great food, and bathrooms are clean constantly especially, during this (COVID)-19"
539,2017-9,"lots of fun, noy very crowded did IOA and universal in the same day rode all the atractions some twice, lots of social distancing, felt safe the entire time, friendly employees. just an awsome time."
540,2017-9,We really enjoyed Universal Studios Orlando with my teenagers. There are a number of attractions for all ages. If you're staying for multiple days I would encourage you to get a pass to go between the parks. You also need a two-park pass if you want to ride the Harry Potter train. If you are with teenagers you don't want to miss The Mummy. The new Borne Stunttacular is the best I have ever seen with special effects don't miss that either.
541,2017-9,Enjoyed Universal’s studio even with the safety guidelines in place. The crowd was very aware and followed guidelines. Crew members was making sure hands were sanitized before entering the ride. I felt safe and still able to enjoy. The wait times seem longer than they actually were.
542,2017-9,"Went to Orlando for a honeymoon extravaganza in August 2019 involving Universal Studios, all Disney parks, SeaWorld, A Manatee Expedition and Busch Gardens. Universal was absolutely amazing, beautiful scenery, well maintained rides, helpful staff and not unreasonable wait times if you plan carefully (made more bareable by fans and air con in the queues!) We even got an extra go on the new Hagrid Ride after a looong queue as it was our honeymoon which was great! Loved the Harry Potter section, being British it is exactly how I would have pictured it, Hogsmeade, Diagon Alley and Hogwarts Castle and the entertainment there were wonderful! Would definitely recommend but plan carefully to avoid long queues!"
543,2017-9,"I would not go to Universal Studio Parks until they stop requiring people to wear masks at ALL times. It was horrible!! We wore our masks as instructed, and our family was mask-shamed by employees even when we took our masks off to eat/drink or breathe. Not to mention it was way too hot to wear a mask! We are medical professionals, and there was no need to wear a mask in a 1/2 empty amusement park outside when it is almost 100 degrees. It causes more harm than good. #FactsOverFear"
544,2017-9,"The Harry Potter rides and exhibits were definitely our favorites, from Escape from Gringotts, to the ride inside Hogwarts, to Hagrid's Motorcyle rides. But there's a lot more to enjoy at Universal Studios, too. The Bourne Stunt show was simply amazing, a seamless integration of live action and CGI that left us wondering when one ended and the other began. Even for adults, the Shrek and Minion shows were a delight.  For those who are wondering, everyone wore masks, and the people in line practiced social distancing. The employees were constantly cleaning and spritzing hand sanitizer on everyone's hands before each ride. Everyone also had their temperature taken before going into the park. My family felt as safe as one can in these strange times."
545,2017-9,"I visited the park with my husband and 3 kids yesterday. Before that I visited the park with my husband 15 years ago and liked it much better now. There weren't many people at the park which meant little or no wait time at all. We were able to do most of the rides twice. Please mind that the park opens at 9am and closes at 5pm. I wish it would close later. Wearing a mask is a must,hand sanitaizer before every ride,temperature check before entering the park. No paper map, you have to download their app. Harry Potter part was our favorite. My 2 year old could do only 2 shows. Most of the kids zone is closed( mini water park and Curious George part).It was a problem to find turkey legs. Overall we had a great day.The only negative is that one day at the Universal studios costs a fortune. Paid around $140 per ticket. The food package per person is $35 which includes water bottle( unlimited drinks) one meal and a snack. We stayed at the hotel across the street from Universal( very convenient)."
546,2017-9,Hardly nobody visiting and getting in early was an plus. Few lines and interaction with others was super. The Irish pub Fennigans was delish! Street actors were adorned and easily watched.
547,2017-9,The service at the quick service restaurants is terrible now with the new procedures in place. It will take at least 20 minutes after you order to get the food. Even longer if you have to pay cash at the register since they really don’t like that. There’s also a line just to get into the restaurant with no option to take it to go. Eat at the fire eaters grill in ioa as it’s the only place that doesn’t do these things although you will have to eat outside. Universal needs to stand up against fear and do things using common sense.
548,2017-9,Our trip to universal Studios was very awesome the characters and the rides was great.seeing spiderman. dinosaur s and all different characters you can imagine.
549,2017-9,"Stayed at Universal's Adventura Hotel this past weekend with my family and had a great time visiting Volcano Bay for the first time and enjoying the parks as always. Universal has been doing an excellent job in creating a safe environment during COVID and making sure guests have an incredible experience.  Most of all, I want to recognize two team members that went above and beyond for us this past trip. First of all, shout out to Savannah who worked the register at Urban Pantry in the Aventura hotel. She provided us excellent service and went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of -- even though we came right before closing for the night. She really made us hungry and tired guests quite welcome and she should be recognized!  The second team member I want to shout out is Scott over at the Hollywood Drive-in Mini Golf. When we were deciding whether to golf before dinner at Bubba Gump Shrimp Co., he advised us to come back once it got dark and gave us some great tips as well as a voucher for a free appetizer for the restaurant. His overall cheerful and helpful attitude made for some excellent customer service skills that should be recognized.  Universal's Team Members are some of the best around! Thank you for your great service!"
550,2017-9,Definitely the best part about all of the experience At Universal Studios Orlando is the fact that you can pretty much go anywhere and they keep the park very nice neat clean and they also do really good safe upkeep of making sure customers feel safe with everything going on through COVID-19. If you’re gonna be in town or for any length of time and you’re gonna come by definitely consider upgrading your tickets at the customer service window before you come in and get the season pass now I do you save money everywhere you go during the time that you’re at the park you also save money at all the stores for merchandise.The rides are exceptional and extremely enjoyable
551,2017-9,"Not as good as disney world in my opinion. Still amazing all the same. Love the mummy ride, and the men in black ride, as well as everything else! But those are my two favourites. The horror makeup show is a great laugh and I love that you can get a duff beer in the park. Its a must do!"
552,2017-9,"Given that our entire lives have been taken over by Covid-19, and the constant onslaught of media attention covering the surge of cases in Flordia, to say I was conflicted about going to Universal Studios in an understatement. Ultimately, my family of 7 decided to go. We even flew there. Here is what I learned and how we controlled for as much risk as possible...  Airport...We decided to avoid shuttles and shared spaces as much as possible. We also bought double-layered masks for extra protection. We parked in self-parking, which allowed us to walk into the terminal without taking a shuttle.  In the airport, we were able to keep 6 feet or more distance at all times. Traffic is low, so this was easy. Rather than sitting at our own gate, we sat at the next one over (which was empty ) to stay away from others.  Once on the plane, which was only half full, we asked if we could move to the back two rows. There were at least two empty rows ahead of those, so we again felt we successfully maintained distance.  Upon arriving at Universal, we rented our own car and set off to Universal's Surfside hotel. The hotel was at less than a third capacity. We were the only ones in our hallway.  Pools got a little busy at night, but still very manageable.  Rather than take the free shuttles from the hotel the next morning, we asked the front desk if we could park at one of the closer resort hotels for the day. We explained we were just trying to reduce our risk. They allowed us to do this. So we parked at the Royal Pacific hotel each day and walked the private path up to universal. Again, not sharing bus rides was nice.  At the park. Universal does an excellent job with spacing and hand sanitizer going on to the rides. They keep distance between rows on the actual rides by allowing every other row to be empty or by separating groups by car. You are never riding with a stranger.  We felt most at risk getting off of rides and departing the Hogwarts Express. While they take such care getting you on rodes safely and separately; it is a free-for-all after the rides. I wish they would have controlled that part better.  Also, the locker situation is probably the riskiest part. There is no way to not need lockers. Some rides even require that you leave your phone. I wish they would change that. I could easily leave my bag, but you need the phone to book virtual line passes. Even though they try to space out access to the lockers, these are tight spaces that are touched by everyone. The easiest fix is to allow people to keep their phones and to recommend all bags to be left in lockers.  The dining facilities are mostly mobile order. Groups are well spaced, and outdoor seating is available. Mealtime was a great chance for a safe mask break.  We are now home and we are quarantining. I have read that at the earliest, we could take a Covid test after 5 days for 60% accuracy. There is still a 40% possibility of a false negative. We will likely take a test on day 5, results usually take 2-3 days and we will decide from there.  The isolation is hard, especially on kids. Our kids play with the neighbors a lot, and now we are watching them out the window. However, I do take seriously my responsibility to not spread the virus if we have it. I hope they come up with more accurate tests that can detect the virus sooner. Most people are not going to self-quarantine unless they know they have it.  In sum, we had a great time, and if you are ok with controlling for all the variables that you can, wearing a mask all day, and responsibility quarantining when you get back...I say go. We walked on rides all 4 days. It was pretty awesome to get to see and experience Harry Potter world and the rest of the attractions at a leisurely pace.  FYI...NO FAST PASS NEEDED...I wouldn't waste the money on a more expensive stay at the more expensive resorts, Surfside is the best deal by far."
553,2017-10,"Let me start off by saying that due to the pandemic, I am awarding 1 extra star to my reviews due to the difficult situation. Universal has improved on a number fo their rides but the draconian attitude by some of their employees made this a miserable vacation. I'll excuse the fact that most of the employees we encountered were just plain rude but there were a few stand outs such as Robert, the team leader at Bank of Gringnots who jumped in front of my wife (violating social distancing guidelines) taking a picture screaming that face masks were required at all times. We tried to explain that we already asked and were told it would be OK provided we kept in mind social distancing guidelines and did it quickly. Robert though remained in our face even when requested to step back and threatened to have us removed from the park if we took anymore pictures. There were others during our visit who we observed who treated guests just as Robert treated us. The hand Sanitizer used at Universal before the rides smells awfully strong of gasoline and is like rubbing snot on your hands. My youngest son hands started to peel and burn after the 3rd day. When we asked if we could apply our own sanitizer (which exceeds recommended requirements), we were told we were not and that failure to apply it could result in being removed from the park. The rudeness of Universal employees plus the disgusting hand sanitizer is a instant zero in my book. The two stars comes from Volcano Bay and the fact that masks were not required and employees were not behaving like Masks Nazis. People kept their distance and enjoyed themselves. As for the main parks, I won't say that we won't return but it will be a long while before I do..."
554,2017-10,"Called today to make a hotel reservation and spoke with RANIA in Reservations. She provided OUTSTANDING top-notch customer service, which is hard to come by these days. She was patient, willing to help answer all of our questions and went above and beyond in offering her help and support. We priced several different Universal properties, and ended making a reservation at our all-time favorite location - Sapphire Falls. But Rania helped us understand what each of the other properties offered and the pricing points of each. Thank you Rania for your help and professionalism."
555,2017-10,I was highly satisfied with their safety precautions during the entire time there. Every ride we got on someone was wiping and spraying after every group.There are signs and everywhere about staying ft apart and there pretty vocal about it if you don't. We went there to surprise the kids for there birthday.This might sound crazy but going during COVID was pretty tight. Although some of the parades and shows was not going the lines to the ride wait was 20 mins at max. Only ride we wasn't able to make it to was the mummy it was virtual and speed pass only and it was all booked up so if you go download the app and virtually book that first.
556,2017-10,"The objective report: Every, I mean EVERY safety precaution is in place. Temperatures taken before entering the hotel or park, wristbands to ensure you went through the temp checkpoint. The six feet distance requirement is serious business...if you're 5.75ft from the next party, a staff member will pop out from nowhere to kindly have you step back. Same with masks...cover nose to chin or you don't go in. Guests are extremely proactive and compliant, staff are kind but mean business. Our boat captain to the park stopped our ride because a kid had his mask on his chin. They are 100% on top of their game.  The perspective: Crowds were tiny in the mornings, no lines for anything except the new Jason Bourne show. This line stretched all the way down the street...UO might need to rethink this strategy as we showed up 3x to try to see the show but it was full every time so we gave up. Walked right onto Hagrid's motorcycle coaster, King King, and Escape from Gringott's.. We had an express pass with our hotel key, but it wasn't necessary as the morning crowd was so small. Heat and masks were fine before noon...afternoons were sweltering and miserable with increasing park crowds.  The verdict: Definitely glad we came, its a much needed respite. Personally, I loved the lack of crowds and spacing for the most part, it almost felt like we had the park to ourselves at times. If safety is the issue. I feel safer here than at my local supermarket. More precautions are taken, and there is a neverending supply of hand sanitizer."
557,2017-10,"Other than Rip Ride Rock-it, the Harry Potter area, and the Mummy, this half of the park is crap. Ditch the Simpsons ride, it’s awful, the fast and furious is junk, the transformers is ok, and the rest are for little kids. Add some more indoor coasters like the mummy to help people enjoy the park while the rain comes each day in the summer. The food is way over priced!"
558,2017-10,My family and I were down in Ft. Lauderdale to attend a wedding. We thought that since we flew all the way down to Florida we might as well go to an amusement park. We chose Universal Studios for our visit and could not have had a better time. While Florida is hot even in October the park itself was a blast. All of the older attractions were well maintained and performed. Any of the new rides/experiences were certainly cutting edge. The actors were are very professional and since we bought the express pass our waits were not too long.
559,2017-10,"We have been WDW APers for years but decided to also get UO passes as well since they offered 3 free months. Since we're blocked out until August at the other park, we decided to do a three day trip. The ease of getting the annual pass was a breeze and all CMs were pleasant and accommodating. It was my first time on a lot of rides (I visited once about 10 years ago), and Hagrid's did not disappoint. We were happy to get virtual queue passes to it, even when we did not arrive until almost lunchtime. One day we rode it about 4 times - although I will say that, on the fourth ride, the CM pulled us off the ride after we were seated to walk all the way back to the simulator to make sure someone in our party could fit into the seat. I find having to do this drill as everyone in the queue watched is unnecessarily humiliating - move it somewhere else! Social distancing was enforced and announcements were made while waiting in line as CMs using cameras could see when people removed their masks. We stayed at a hotel on property that was sub-par, but that's another review .. Definitely looking forward to using our passes again soon."
560,2017-10,"It was a beautiful day in Florida with my family it was 5 like my grandchild and my handicap son they where the first set of questions and the second step of questions where how was this park going to handle covit 19 before we entered the park we got there about 9:00 in the morning we where all brite eyed and bushy tail some of us where. We started at the main garage heading up to park it cost 25 dollars to park for the day we did this for 5 days with tickets with water park option on tickets and our tickets had to be used consecutively no gaps in the week straight our the tickets our no good . we where told the rules in line at customer's the mains entrance of the and garage. Must where a mask at all times unless you go to the rest areas they or eat choose you can. take them off if child 1 to 3 did not have to where a mask but if you have medical condition you did not have to either like my one son who is handicap i had to where his special blue and white band show he does not have to where one .because of his conditions that and have to carry a handicap pass around. my neck to show on the rides but there is. a but in everything we do in life .it is you must where a mask in the main line of the ride you our standing for that is everyone handicap our not even on the ride it self. only for the area can they not where a. mask he did not.so all the rules out of way and checking in with tickets we started our way to islands of adventure .with marvel rides like doctor d doom,spiderman, hulk,great start of the day kids love the rides here lots of eye candy the water rides our good,and Harry Potter area with haggard's add to the. mix family's new favorites even staff where great through all this covit 19 .it was so safe no problems on our end here one of the best places for your handicap child or adult i can not say any thing else about this park great job with your help and customs training thankyou for always reaching out to the people's fo what i seen hope they keep with this care for the long hall thankyou universal. For giving my handicap son and family a good time we will be manny more times keep up the good work and safety of all customer's so everyone a must to always in Orlando. All i can people go out and have fun here"
561,2017-10,"I've been to Universal Studios many times, but never have I been as disappointed as I was this last time. Many employees were very rude. I almost wanted to tell them that they needed to go to Disney World to get an etiquette lesson. I understand that employees may be overwhelmed with Covid, but not being able to treat your guests correctly is an issue. My family was 6-8 feet away from two people in front of us. The lady complained that my son did not have his mask on (he sneezed in his mask) because he took it off to wipe his nose. She told the Male worker at the Hagrid ride. The worker asked us for him to put it back on, which he was in the process of doing so. When we got to the hand sanitizer (after putting it on all day with zero issues with employees), my husband's hand was dry and he asked if he really had to have it. He wasn't mean about it. He was very nice. The girl told him yes, so he did. He put it in his hands and rubbed it in. She immediately said ""sir, you wiped it off"" and caused a fuss that was inexcusable. He told her that she could smell his hands and that it was wiped in. She continued to fuss loudly. The Male employee who previously asked for my Son's mask to be put back on (since he was wiping his nose from sneezing) came over and loudly TOLD US to get out of the line and we had to leave. We asked him why and he had zero answers besides being a jerk and telling us to get out of line loudly again. We asked for his name and he refused. We asked his manager for his name and she refused to give it. This is very unprofessional. We did end up riding the ride but to cause an inexcusable commotion was ridiculous. The staff was horrible. Had there been a serious issue, I wonder how they would have dealt with it, but they were horrible. The service was horrible the last day we were there as we were there for 4 days. I've never had treatment like this before at any Park and I cannot believe Universal would employ such horrible people."
562,2017-10,"Amazing, everyting about it is great. Transformers ride is superb, MIB also great, in fact it's all brilliant, Diagon Alley is by far the best. A must do when visiting Orlando"
563,2017-10,"I thought long and hard about this review. Do I post do I not?! Does it matter?! So here it is. The issue I have was the height for the rides. No no I am not wanting my child unsafe but I read the height requirements for my son as this was a trip for him since we did Disney for my daughter. He loves dinosaurs, super hero(hints the spider web in his hair in sport of Spider-Man), sharks, and more things interest him there than Disney. So I check and see most the rides I think he will enjoy and take note of the height requirements. I also take him to the doctor in February for his 4year old check up and made sure he was the height he needed to be before even thinking of booking and planning this vaca. Finally after knowing he was tall enough and knowing the cost we book a June vaca. Note I took him in February to the doctor and he was 1/4inch taller than what he needed to be and of course he only could grow as June approached! So we arrive and we did both parks and my son cried in sadness as I did too(while he wasn’t looking cause I walked away as my husband consoled him) but only out of rage that as a parent I did all I could to make this go as planned for him! At one point we went to the line that measured him and ok’d him but once we arrive to get on the ride they brought another measure stick and it was literally an inch different. I had one of the ride people walk back with me to the beginning of the line and we all saw the difference and she literally said “ you will Have to take this up with a manager as I am to go off this measure.” I was shocked as so was the other guest in line who witnessed this. This particular ride was the Popeyes water ride. I feel I wasted my money his trip wasn’t all it should be. I feel the park took something from us which is our great experience we should have been able to witness as parents and he live and remember as a child. We live 17hours away had to take 2 days to get there with the cost of a layover hotel and this place needs to keep that in mind and check that all of their ride measure sticks are correct and match their online postings. Also I think they should bring back the jaws ride. It is better than fast and the furious in my opinion which was one of the few he got to do."
564,2017-10,"Seems silly to write a review of such a well known place but this is worth taking the time to do. I don’t know if I have seen any other business taking COVID so seriously. I was not worried for my safety even once. They actually took our temperatures and took their time to look at them and look at us. They gave us hand sanitizer before EVERY ride and wiped everything down EVERY TIME! No noses sticking out of masks for guests or workers and they carefully seated everyone to keep social distancing. A+ Universal, we were impressed!!"
565,2017-10,"Right now the wait times are nothing. If not scared of getting CV, now is time to come. The parks are super clean and they take the mask wearing seriously. We have watching people spray down everything multiple times daily. We normally stay at one of main resorts to get Express passes but switched to sapphire falls since not busy and saved tons of money. No need for Express most rides are walk ons even if they say 20 or 25min wait. The mummy usually says 20mins but it's a walk on. Hagrids is only one that is virtual line but throughout day can get multiple rides. We have ridden hagrids over 20 times this week. Insane."
566,2017-10,This was a family 👪 trip and the ages ran from 7 to 80 (me). I brought our own mobility scooters for my wife and I. That helped because there is a lot of walking 🚶. The park was not very crowded so that was nice. The old folks even road Spiderman and Jurassic Park. The only bummer was the shows were closed and for the price I was disappointed 😞.
567,2017-10,"How Can you rate something so unique and excellent as Universal Orlando resort.. It was Absolutely amazing, theillibg and breathtaking. We vane all the way from Dennark and will definitely come back. Second to none!"
568,2017-10,"We visited during the pandemic. I was highly impressed with all the staff was doing to make things safe. Lots of social distancing, staff are giving you sanitizer, they are cleaning rides. Crowd levels were pretty low for us at least. I felt pretty safe there and had a great time."
569,2017-10,"Universal did a great job with keeping the parks clean! Here are the things they did: - Morning parking is every other space, so when we got out of our car, we are distanced from other cars. Eventually the spots are filled, as there are cars next to us when we return. - temp check upon entry - Continuous disinfecting of moving walkway railings. There are people at one end of each walkway, continuously wiping the railings - 6ft social distance on most places - using ID (instead of fingerprints) for the ticket identification - virtual lines for long lines, so even if you wait, most of the waiting is outdoor. The queue move swiftly indoor, limiting the time spent in a crowd indoor - 12 ft distance on indoor queue, often skipping a row, so you are always at least 6ft away from other parties - mandatory hand sanitizer prior to boarding every ride - roller coaster: roughly 3 rows apart between parties - theater like seating (shrek, bourne, etc): at least 3 seats apart between parties and every other row seating - compartment ride (hogwarts express, gringotts, simpson, spiderman, etc): one compartment per party. - Rides are sprayed after every rides. - Most store doors are open to minimize touchings - door knobs, surfaces, railings are wiped often - order food via app and we take the plates from the tray to minimize touching - everybody wears masks inside the park - some decor are removed to provide more space for people - reduced crowd, I am not sure if this is intentional. There might be a crowd entering the park, but once inside, the crowd dispersed throughout the park.  We had a great time there and felt safe. Thank you Universal! We especially love the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, the low crowd really enabled us to enjoy the details of Hogsmeade & Diagon Alley.  And Bourne Stuntacular is really awesome! They just opened last week and it is a must see!  I hope this helps with your decision whether to go during this time!"
570,2017-10,"I’ve been going since a little girl and it’s always the best experience. I’ve seen this place transform over those years in so many ways and it only gets better and better. Due to COVID my trips have slowed, and events have been cancelled but that’s okay because they do a great job keeping you connected and in the loop. I went recently after the state lockdown and while it did feel a little weird, they did an amazing job ensuring guest wore their mask properly, social distancing was in full effect and the trip was still just as fun as ever. Wait times weren’t too long and the cleaning and disinfecting after rides or throughout public areas were on point!! I always do Universal first then head over to islands for the more thrilling rides."
571,2017-10,I’m a larger fellow sitting at around 5’11 and weighing around 300lbs. Many of the thrill rides were inaccessible to me. I spent thousands between tickets and hotels and food and transportation and when I asked for a partial refund because I couldn’t access nearly any of the rides I was interested in I was told that because it was so late in the day they were unable to help me. But it took nearly the whole day walking around and waiting In line to even find out that I was too big for the rides in the first place!
572,2017-10,"Stayed at the Sapphire Falls, great choice, and easy access to the parks by boat. Purchased a 3-day pass and for 2 of us around $600.  June 8th was the first of 3 days. Was nice having a ticket where we could bounce back and forth between the two for 3-days.  Just opened I believe a few days prior. May have been a bit more chaotic..so new for everyone and having to deal with COVID. Precautions were taken everywhere....everyone was masked up and hand sanitizer at every turn.  I have not been to Universal since they first opened...so yes, things have defiantly changed. We did enjoy the parks being quiet, with the heat and having to wear a mask, at times it got a little overwhelming.  Many attractions have very little wait times, so nice. The downfall of COVID, parks closed early (I believe there was a curfew in effect also). We are huge Disney people and night time is the best...so we were looking forward to all the lights of the evening hours. No parades and much of the other entertainment was canceled. But still, much to do and see. As time goes...I am sure more this will open  This was a last-minute trip, because all of our other choices kept on getting canceled. I did not get to do any research in this area...but I am still glad we got to see and enjoy Universal.  My only real ""huge"" gripe. and this pertains to attraction anywhere....WHY do you feel the need to charge SO much for water.... I know you have fountains. ...but warm water and not the best tasting 😞."
573,2017-11,"Most of the rides they did good at keeping 6 ft apart. Except Jimmy Fallon escape from New York. Multiple kids working there said to stay 3 feet apart! I of course moved 6 ft from person in front of me and young girl working told me to move closer, needs to be 3 feet away. I tried to explain safe distance is 6 feet but she didn’t listen or care. I was amazed in today’s environment multiple kids running the ride thought 3 feet was the requirement. This is too important to have teenagers running the place. With all the unemployment in the state, can’t they hire more adults?"
574,2017-11,"We bought military universal tickets $204 an adult for both parks and it was OK, the first day and yes social distancing was in full force. The food app. doesn't work in every restaurant a fast pass was useful it wasn't to crowded. The next day was better but for what I paid the fun just wasn't like universal fun. I 'd recommend waiting unless you want lots of peace and quite."
575,2017-11,We did the two parks in one day with three teenage boys and had a blast. It wouldn't have been possible to get that accomplished if the crowds were normal (non-Covid time). The park did a good job of keeping everyone safe and distanced while still providing a fun environment.  All of the Harry Potter rides were amazing and so much fun. There wasn't a thing we did all day that we didn't enjoy. Really glad we still made the trip.
576,2017-11,"Had Fass Pass from the Hard Rock Hotel.These are suppose to be good up to and on the day of check out. On our day of check out we stowed our bags and headed to the park. The first ride was to be the HULK coaster. Showed the Fast Pass Hard Rock Room card and the attendant said it was expired and took the card and told me to go to guest services if I wanted to ""get ahead of the line"" as if I had done something wrong manner.Needless to say lost 2 hrs park time lost doing the social distancing thing while wondering what went wrong. Long story short also it rained half the day so we missed alot of new rides because of someones error. I have saved alot and sacrificed alot to make this vacation happen for my family and park personnel seem to not care one bit."
577,2017-11,My family and I enjoyed a wonderful time at both Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure. Both theme parks did an excellent job with social distancing and ensuring people wore their masks in a friendly reminder sort of way. There was no overcrowding. They offered virtual lines for some of the more popular rides like Hagrid’s Motorbike Adventure but that too was great as we just showed up at our self chosen time and proceeded to the ride. While the line was long when we returned to this one particular ride it was very very quick. Each ride operator delivered each rider with a fresh pump of hand sanitizer prior to getting on the ride. I felt both parks did an excellent job of offering a great experience with germ control! FYI I am very particular when in comes to cleanliness and both parks exceeded my expectations. So grab your mask and head out to the parks and enjoy a day in the Florida sunshine once again.  Me and my family can’t wait to go back!
578,2017-11,"This trip was taken shortly after USO reopened during the Covid19 pandemic. The whole facility and staff made sure that EVERYTHING was sanitized and clean. Face masks are required and temp checks are done before you step foot in the park. Some stores and events were shut down but that was understandable. The longest we had to wait for a ride was 55 mins which was the Kong ride, all others were less than 20 mins. Spent a lot of time in WWoHP as we usually do and never get bored. Didn’t get to ride Hagrids ride as a bad lightning storm rolled in. The only thing we didn’t like was the shorter operation hrs (9-7). We understood why though. All in all, USO and IoA is an amazing vacation spot and can’t wait to return."
579,2017-11,"Additional procedures for safety very good, some guests could use reminders about masks being on. Overall felt safe and had a lot of fun."
580,2017-11,"We are a family with adult children. All of us are fortunate survivors of mild cases of coronavirus. As a celebration of our good health, we spent the July 4 weekend at Universal Orlando and Islands of Adventure. Both were immaculate. Yes the face masks and hand sanitizer can be a pain, but they are necessary to keep everyone at the parks safe. We thought the staff did great in enforcing safety measures. Lines were short and the parks weren't crowded! We had a perfect weekend enjoying most of our favorite attractions and those wonderful Harry Potter fish 'n chips."
581,2017-11,"2nd trip since reopening. (Annual pass holders) Visited over 4th weekend. Lots of hand sanitizer and 6ft markers and always have ur mask on...got the cooling covers u can wear around ur neck that keep u cool and we soaked them in ice water occasionally which helped with the heat, because honestly from 8am until noon was all we could endure with masks in the FL heat-I dunno how the employees tolerate it. We hit the pools mid day. And sadly since the parks are closing early it wasn’t worth getting changed and going back to the park for our express passes that start at 4pm...we have basically lost that perk, previously we had 5-6 hrs express pass. We did enjoy an almost empty park. And thanks for the AP line-this needs to stay. No shade if ya wanted to line up for Bourne, so with a mask on in the heat-couldn’t do it. Why does this NOT have a virtual line? Overall we always have fun here. Enjoyed Sunday morning in an almost empty park."
582,2017-11,"Be forewarned, if you are a person size, as I am, you will not be able to ride 50% of the rides. I can ride every ride at WDW without issue, the rides at Universal were made for people no taller the 5' 6"" and under 250 lbs. If you are outside of those dimensions you are out of luck as far as rollercoasters, or strap in rides go. It's a shame their main competitor can accommodate individuals of all shapes and sizes, but Universal decides to cut out people of size. If you have a choice, go elsewhere."
583,2017-11,"Universal needs a face lift. Buildings looked “tired”. Park attendance was minimal, hardly any one walking around. I guess because everyone else was at Harry Potter land in Islands of Adventure. Universal looked very much like a concrete fair. Not many rides which interested me. Was disappointed in atmosphere."
584,2017-11,"First let me say that there should be separate parking costs to just walk through City Walk if you don't plan on going to the theme parks but anyway. Nothing was really open when we arrived. Yes it was during COVID-19 so I wasn't surprised but I felt like I wasted money on parking. MASKS ARE REQUIRED, there are sanitizing stations throughout and temperature checks. I appreciated the staff enforcing proper masks wearing as well. You could only pull the mask down while eating or drinking. We thought maybe we would go to Islands of Adventure but with the Florida heat plus masks - we will try that again hopefully next year."
585,2017-11,"Universal Studios We were there when the park first opened with all the Covid 19 measures in place. I work as a NP and I was very impressed!! There was always someone cleaning and sanitizing on every attraction. Note: Face masks are required!  I highly suggest staying at one of the on site hotels. We stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel and it was very convenient walking to the park or catching a boat! We also were able to enter the park early. At the time we were there, a 7:00pm curfew was in place. Check before you arrive and try to make reservations especially for dinner.  Download the app so you can schedule ride times. I would also get the dual park ticket option.  We had a fantastic time and sincerely hope you will too!  Safe travels!"
586,2017-11,"We didn't wait longer than 30 minutes to ride any ride. Crowds are small due to the fear of covid. This made it great for us, as we were able to ride every ride in both parks, some twice, in a day and a half. They do require face coverings which was the downside. It is hot and uncomfortable wearing them. They have employees walking around monitoring that will tell you to get your mask up over your nose. You are also required to use hand sanitizer before boarding every ride. If you're not worried, now is the time to go."
587,2017-11,We spent a fun filled day following UA’s strict social distancing guidelines. They are running at 1/4 capacity to avoid crowding. All the rides are open. The only negative was the horrid fast-food burger and fries we ate at one of their app places. We were under the impression that these were the only we could use but it was an erroneous impression since many sit-down restaurants and food trucks started to open up after twelve but it was too late. The app should strive to explain that the fast-food was not the only choice.
588,2017-11,"We enjoyed visiting this park, even during the Covid crisis. It was not crowded as capacity was limited. With three kids including a four year-old we were able to enjoy pretty much all there is to do and see. Wearing a mask and adhering to the health and safety protocols we felt pretty safe. The Hollywood roller coaster is an absolute must."
589,2017-11,"Only one of the best places to go and visit without a doubt since, as they say in the other opinions they have seen so far, it is fantastic because it has the attractions of most of the movies and some for Children, Youth, and even adults."
590,2017-11,My favorite part of this attraction was how safe I felt being in the park amid the COVID-19 pandemic. They ensured that people wore mask and sanitized their hands before and after each ride. We were able to get on rides w/out extreme waits in line as the number of patrons was not excessive.
591,2017-11,"The park is super cool with great attractions. Ridiculously priced though, they nickel and dime you for everything. It's crazy lockers $2. To ride certain things. Drinks food all of it is insanely expensive. They need more shaded areas too. The mask requirement thing during Covid 19 is beyond annoying. Staff is very customer friendly though."
592,2017-11,"As part of our family holiday we visited Universal Studios and loved it. having visited the Shrek, Minions and Simpsons ride we queued for the Transformers ride. I loved it. A hug transformer fan I had my photo taken with Optimus Prime and then Bumble Bee came out. My favourite, I was caught up in the whole magic. I cannot fault any of the rides, but Transformers was my favourite. We enjoyed some ice cream and bought some souvenirs, the photos are really overpriced, but the staff will take photos with your phone and /or camera if you ask. I did buy some of the photos as souvenirs."
593,2017-12,What a blast!! First time at the park! My family appreciated the obvious efforts of the staff to keep the park sanitized and covid safe. The patrons seemed respectful of the rules and guidelines. Lines all moved swiftly. Such a great experience.
594,2017-12,"We felt so safe here beause they are so diligent about wearing masks, using hand sanitizer before entering each ride, social distancing, and cleaning. There were team members everywhere standing by to answer questions also. We had purchased the express pass and one day two park ticket. We were able to get on every ride we wanted and eat breakfast and lunch by 1:30, and we reallt didn't need the Express pass except that we were trying to do both parks in 9 hours. We were in Orlando for a long weekend with only one day at Universal and one at Legoland, but I would certainy recommend you spend a more leisurely day at each of the three parks. We had heard reports of difficulty using mobile ordering, but at the Leaky Cauldron and the multi-food place in Springfield, we were escorted to our table by a TM who helped us mobile order. The highlight was the single family experience at Ollivander's. My grandson was able to have the full wand experience by signing up for a timeslot, so someone in your party is guarenteed to be picked. Although there are a few rides I would skip (Fast and Furious, Shrek 4D, ) most were fun. We loved the Gringott's ride, the interactive wand stations, and Men in Black. We also loved the characters that were stationed everywhere, either on floats or platforms."
595,2017-12,"My partner and I were here a couple of years ago and were blown away. Universal Studios is significantly better than all of Disney. The rides and experiences are phenomenal, especially the vr rides. Would 100 percent recommend spending a few days here!"
596,2017-12,"Great experience! Hardly any wait on rides. EVERYONE had masks. Staff was friendly and greeted us with hand sanitizer before entering any ride and ALWAYS reminded to pull masks up to cover nose etc. seriously I washed my hands a gazillion times per park policy. Lots of distancing and sanitizing observed.  Kids playground area was closed, but rides were operating. Lots of food stations had limited hours.  We enjoyed our experience and would recommend going now. Lots of memories made and had a blast. Walked through rows and rows of what would be wait lines sooo ya... now was a good time to go for us."
597,2017-12,"Our trip to Universal Studios was ok just average, I definitely think it would of been better without all Covid stuff going on as we had to wear a mask the whole time in the hot humid air however they do have sections where you can take a break from your mask. One thing that bothered me is that they do not do a good job explaining how things work there such as their app, we bought the tickets at the booth and the lady in the both was only interested in trying to up sale us. Hindsight I thought this is where she could of at least told us about the phone app that you can do many things on. I think if I would of known about the phone app right from the get go our experience would of been better. I will say that the staff did a great job with the social distancing they have it down and made us feel safe. One other thing they should update you on before you pay admission is what attractions are closed we were disappointed by this because we were looking forward to seeing everything! So in all they need to work on their communication other then that the park is fun and like I said if all the Covid stuff was not going on I think it would of been a lot better."
598,2017-12,"We just got back from a Florida trip and had a great time at Universal on June 14th. As we had limited time, we did the VIP group tour. I did the VIP group tour a year ago and compared to post-Covid, the experience was just as fun. If you are on limited time (say you can only spend a day at the parks), the VIP is a great option.  VIP sounds pricey, but when you add in all the benefits it's worth it. It's not just a fast pass, you're literally given front of line access to every ride during the tour (even on a slow day this will save hours of time). You also get breakfast and a full lunch included (starter, meal, dessert).  The main differences are first that you currently have to wear masks. If you've not worn one in a park like this all day, I recommend you try this out first. I recommend a highly breathable mask and it can't hurt to bring a motion sickness tablet if you get woozy, as it can take a little adjustment depending on the heat. Second, the tour guide used to be able to put your items in a backpack and now they have to be placed in lockers. Third, the buffet-style options of the past for food are now a sit-down service for each meal. However, you get more than your share of food, so I did not see this as an issue.  Finally, if you can get Paul for your tour I would highly recommend him! Paul had some great experiences and stories that made it another wonderful tour. He was so kind and an expert at gauging the group's mood and interest in terms of what we wanted to do during the day. I would be happy to do this tour again and especially with Paul."
599,2017-12,"We visited the park June 14th - 17th and had an awesome experience. Sunday was busier than the rest of the days, but even then it wasn’t bad. Having to wear a mask the whole time is a bit annoying, but you’re able to sit down and take a break from wearing them when eating / drinking, or in the U-Rest designated areas. We rode every single ride in both Universal Studios Resort and Island of Adventure, and the longest line that we had to wait in was 30 minutes. I highly recommend purchasing the refillable cups for drinks throughout the day. It’s worth the cost. I also recommend eating in a restaurant where you make a reservation and actually sit down to eat, instead of the cafeteria style restaurants. You will spend almost the same amount of money and eat much better food. Also, some of the rides require you to store your items in a locker. Here is something to remember with the lockers: IF the locker requires you to scan your fingerprint in order to access it, then you will need to store everything in the locker, including your cellphone, wallet, fanny pack, etc. If the locker requires you to scan your park entry ticket (whether it is a physical ticket or a mobile ticket on your phone) then you can wear a fanny pack on the ride, and/or keep your phone with you. Don’t lock your phone up if the locker requires you to use your ticket to unlock it after the ride. Otherwise, you will have to get assistance from an employee and show your ID once you get your belongings out of the locker. I learned this the hard way. :)"
600,2017-12,Staff is very unfriendly right now. I thought the lines would be faster because not that many people at the park but some rides take an hour still. You have to wear face mask all day in the heat. They say stuff to anyone that has it to low. You have to order food through your phone you can't go through line anymore. Definitely a waste of a few hundred bucks today wait til life is normal!!!!
601,2017-12,"Okay, so Universal totally stole Mr. Disney's idea. The plan from Universal was this: build an amusement park in Orlando and get patronage from tourists who were already here for Disney World. (You can tell I'm pretty loyal to the Mouse.) But I must say, I enjoyed my time here even more than my day at the Magic Kingdom during my last visit. These are big words, but here's why: -Crowd management is key. Unlike the Magic Kingdom, I never found myself flabbergasted at the amount of time I spend in line. Considering I was here during a holiday weekend, the lines really weren't bad at all! -Harry Potter. They have tripped the area dedicated to JK Rowling's illustrious franchise, and it is completely epic. The Hogwarts Express, the (overpriced but delicious) frozen butterbeer, the fish and chips at Hog Head's tavern, the new state-of-the-art VR-type rides, and the lights show on Hogwarts castle at night make for a completely magical experience.  There is too much to do here in one day! It's a billion theme parks in one! If you're in Orlando, you'd be a fool to miss this. And--unlike Disney World--the lines are so short that there is no fast pass nessisary."
602,2017-12,Fun family time for all ages. Even my 5 year old could ride all the rides except 2. I would suggest get express pass then you have to wait at most 20mins. We have yearly passes so we will go many times. They took care of us even with covid -19 issues.
603,2017-12,"Our first time at universal studios was excellent! I was pleasantly surprised on all levels - specifically the employees. I have seen many reviews describing rude employees, but for the most part I experienced quite the opposite. Some of the rides were so fantastic that I did them a LOT - The Incredible Hulk coaster 14 times in one day, and Revenge of the Mummy 13 times. This was my first time visiting Universal. We didn’t eat much from the parks but what we did get to enjoy didn’t disappoint. (You HAVE to try the butter beer fudge at Huneydukes!) I am so glad I went during coronavirus - we never waited over 30 minutes for a single ride our entire trip. Having to wear a mask was a little annoying but honestly, I didn’t notice it much. Not to mention Volcano Bay is the best water park in the world. P.S - the employees working at the Hulk deserve a raise, especially Bailey!"
604,2017-12,Had a wonderful time at universal!! I felt safer there then in the grocery store from covid. Everything was spaced six feet apart. There are virtual lines and the employees were sanitizing nonstop. What a fun day got on every ride.
605,2017-12,Universal is incredible. Clean park awesome rides fun for the whole family. Wish i lived in florida i would visit more often.
606,2017-12,First time Halloween horrors was great second time more leisurely just as great. Definitely will come back again.
607,2017-12,"I should qualify this review with the fact that we went on the first day back from the covid outbreak. June 5, 2020. I understand they have to reduce their liability but the social distance crap got old fast. I highly recommend you DO NOT GO TO THESE PARKS until life gets back to normal. That is unless you like wearing a mask or really like EVERY EMPLOYEE nagging you to wear it properly or if you like being made to use hand sanitizer on every ride. (I refused after doing it a few times. I wasnt touching anything and it was drying my hands out). Not to mention that if you take out the 248 restaurants and 367 souvenir shops, there are literally only 6-7 rides for people over 56”. We had fast passes and rode everything we could/wanted to in 2hrs. So we did it again. And again until it got monotonous. Ive been to a great number of parks and i swear i was shocked at how little there actually was to do. We will be hitting up somewhere else next time we need thrill rides."
608,2017-12,"Being prepared and knowing what to expect is paramount to enjoying the new reality of a theme park visit. Temperature screening is quick. Face covering is required from the temp check forward. The only time face coverings may be removed is when eating (sitting at a table) or dirking. Pro tip- bring two or more face coverings per day, they will get wet, sweaty, and uncomfortable. I recommend two different types. The fishing neck and face guards are a great option to get a break from a mask. Most rides will require you to keep the covering on while riding. We did have one rogue employee tell us to put covering on while walking with a drink.  The major issue we found was a vast amount of misinformation and incorrect information. All queues have blue lines showing where to stand to ensure six feet or two meters from the party in front of you. This will cause queues to appear much longer than they are. All riders must use hand sanitizer prior to ridding each ride (great job Universal). There are also hand sanitizer dispensers after each ride and all over the park. They also spray and wiped rides between riders. Most rides will have rows between parties, this will cause long waits for key attractions. Attractions that require lockers have LONG waits for lockers. Restaurants are at 25 percent occupancy. This will cause long waits for tables. Use the app and pre-order to save hours.  There is no valet parking at the park or hotels."
609,2017-12,"I was one of first group who had a chance to sneak peak of new normal prior opening on June 5th to the public. First moment we walked in, I felt like coming back to the United States after September 11th. Tears were streaming down my eyes. Thanks Goodness for glasses and mask to hide my emotions. I personally think everyone who works in the park tries to do the best under the circumstances. I felt safe (germs wise) and didn't even need to use my sanitizer. I hope general public follows the instructions of the personnel: keep their distance, use sanitizer, and keep their masks on! We are all in this together!"
610,2017-12,"I solely went to Universal to enjoy The Wizarding World of Harry Potter and it was an awesome experience! Dressing in my Hufflepuff garb, getting my own wand that can be used throughout the park, interacting with the world itself, and drinking a nice cold frozen Butterbeer were among the highlights. Our group was entertained all day, even those less interested in the book series. I'd love to return one day!"
611,2017-12,"My roommate is the biggest fan and in the summer we went there for like a week to explore and I must say, it's a very cool place. All of the kids are going crazy here."
612,2017-12,"Don't go expecting Disney, it's not, but good in it's own way. Lots to see and I mean a lot. Seems almost disjointed, so, look up what all there is beforehand so that you know.  What was an A+: is Harry Potter (Wizarding World of) with the 3 broomsticks restaurant (food excellent) and all of the decor. The hogwarts ride in the big school - castle was an amazing ride mixed with roller coaster and 3d all in one! man is it fun. Butter beer carts everywhere, the train between parks (Hogwarts Express) were all amazing. Teens loved it and seemed very authentic. Knockturn alley is almost impossible to find, but cool in and of itself.  men in black ride is fun. Juraisic park portion is fun, especially meeting blue and boat ride - wait for the end of the ride, better than Disney's splash mtn. Dr Seuss land is pretty amazing. King Kong ride is worth the wait and another amazing 3d ride, where kong fights over the top of the bus.  Gru came by and it was fun. ET ride is good. Transformers is good. The candy factory by old jaws site.  Super hero area is pretty cool with heroes coming out and riding around, letting pictures being taken. If you like really fun roller coaster rides, go on the ""Hulk!"" It is fast, thrilling, upside down shoot you into the sky type ride.  Overall a good experience. Plan on spending money. Plan on a lot of time. On equal par with Disney for fun and memory making."
613,2018-1,"We visited with our 2 young kids prior to visiting the Disney parks. It is definitely geared towards older kids, teens and adults but there was still plenty for young kids as well. Everyone loved it and the food in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter was excellent!"
614,2018-1,"Wow, it's already reopening! Can't wait to return! Were getting a 3 day pass soon! This place is amazing. So much better than Disney. Stuff for the whole family. Gonna take my mom and sister for the first time, I'm sure they will love it! The staff are amazing and the food is surprisingly cheap and delicious. Rides are SOOO fun! City walk is also really neat. And that's already open. Amazing times can't wait to return! Definitely the best theme park in america! Because when you wanna woah, there's only one place to go!"
615,2018-1,"They have 3 parks; Universal Studios Florida, Universal’s Islands of Adventure and Volcano Bay. Volcano Bay is a water park, other 2 are theme parks. If you are a crazy Harry Potter fan, you MUST visit both the theme parks. We went during a week day and were able to finish both parks in 2 days without express pass. There's a Hogwart’s Express train that takes you from one park to another but for that you need ticket to both parks which allows you to visit both parks on same day. Butter beer in the Hogwart’s castle is a must. I would suggest finishing Harry Potter rides in Universal’s Islands of Adventure first as soon as you enter Universal, lines start growing between 11 & 2. You WILL get completely wet in Popeye’s ride, there is a dryer outside the ride for a $5. Volcano bay water park has multiple tube rides, they check your weight before you ride so that it is safe to ride. Aqua Coaster ride was the highlight. It is a roller coaster water ride which allows 2 to 4 riders per tube. They have a wave pool with beach like sand and chairs. There's a lazy river and a crazy river, you have to wear life jacket. It has a 80 degree slide from top of volcano mountain. You stand inside a tube and the floor beneath your legs opens. It scratches your back, I could see everyone’s back getting red rashes. There's a Bus stand for Universal between universal studios entrance and universal parking. Free shuttle buses run to universal hotels. There is also a free shuttle for Volcano Bay park."
616,2018-1,"Just mind blowing. They have 3 parks; Universal Studios Florida, Universal’s Islands of Adventure and Volcano Bay. Volcano Bay is a water park, other two are theme parks. If you are a crazy Harry Potter fan, you MUST visit both the theme parks. We went during a non holiday season in February during a week day. We were able to finish both the parks in two days without taking express pass. There is a Hogwart’s Express train that takes you from one park to another but for that you need ticket to both parks wherein you can visit both the parks on same day. Butter beer in the Hogwart’s castle is a must. I would suggest finishing Harry Potter rides in Universal’s Islands of Adventure first as soon as you enter Universal. Go as soon as park opens, lines start growing between 11 to 2. Shreik in Universal Studios Florida was a literal torture, we did not like it. You WILL get completely wet in Popeye’s ride, so make sure you carry additional clothes for the ride. There is a dryer outside the ride for a $5. Volcano bay water park was just fun. It has multiple tube rides, they check your weight every time before you ride so that it is safe to ride. Aqua Coaster ride was the highlight. It is a roller coaster water ride which allows minimum of 2 and maximum of 4 riders per tube. They have a wave pool with beach like sand and chairs. There is a lazy river that you can relax on a tube. There is also a crazy river with water flowing at a faster rate, you have to wear life jacket to go in. There is a 80 degree slide from the top of volcano mountain. You stand inside a tube and the floor beneath your legs opens and you slide down fast. Almost every one complained that it scratches your back, I could see everyone’s back getting red rashes. Overall universal studios was a total fun. I highly recommend if you are visiting Orlando.  There is a Bus stand for Universal. This place is between universal studios entrance and universal parking. Free shuttle buses run to universal hotels. There is also a to and fro free shuttle for Volcano Bay park."
617,2018-1,I liked when I went to this theme park. It holds up to its name that when you ride the attractions in the park it does feel like you're part of the movies. The one store I liked going into was the Ciber Store that sold movie props from classic Universal Movies.
618,2018-1,"Omg !!! Universal studios is absolutely amazing !!! Beat DIsney by far for my whole family . What an incredible day of fun , so exciting . The themes and the certain lands were so awesome so well done and creative . Simpsons land , not a big Simpsons person myself but man did they ever do this right . I loves it ! Every ride is unbelievable and sooo much fun . The whole atmosphere was out of this world that great . E.T. Well I’m a huge ET fan and couldn’t wait to come and buy some et stuff . And I think I bought it all ( stuffed ones, sweaters, tshirts, pen, towel, socks , lanyard .... omg made my day and the ride still one of the best I have been on . They did it justice for sure and you can’t just go on once believe you will ride it again and again it’s that great . The rock it roller coaster amazing ! Pick your own song and have a hell of ride ( limp bizkit does it justice Haha ). The mummy ride incredible , I mean everything is just that much fun and that incredible . And we waited 5mins-20 mins the longest how awesome is that . Can’t do that at Disney . Get the one meal pass definately worth it , you get fries burger and you can switch pop for a milkshake and pick a dessert ( like the big donut from the Simpsons and others definately worth the price . I really recommend it . We also bought the picture package which I probably didn’t get as much as I should of to make it worth it but oh well still worth it in the end got some family pics . And some places can take pic automatically without a person doing it . So I would recommend buying it . But definately don’t miss out it’s a must see and then a must see and do it all over again lol ."
619,2018-1,"I asked my partner for adjectives to quickly describe the experience we had at Universal Studios Florida: Exciting, Imaginative, Transporting, Epic, American! Which actually does pretty much sum up this park. I was very excited about visiting Universal Studios because there is nothing really comparable in Europe. Suffice to say it does not disappoint! The park and its attractions are world class, from the huge thrill rides, down to the smallest details you notice as you are walking around, you are totally immersed in movie land!  As a big Harry Potter fan (and a Londoner) I was delighted by how accurately London was represented outside Diagon Alley and the seamless transition into the magical world behind the passageways. I use Kings Cross Station regularly, so to see a scaled down replica of it standing at the back of the park was very surprising. Even more surprising were the real to life announcements of trains to Peterborough, calling at Stevenage and Huntingdon! They have a team working on the attractions who seem to want not just to add some fun rides and thrills, they want to go above and beyond to present unique and joyful experiences.  Being located around a large lagoon meant it was very easy to get our bearings and to make our way around the park without too much foot traffic. We were lucky when we visited in that we had fairly low crowds, so never waited much longer than 20 minutes to get on a ride (apart from Gringotts)!  The food offering is fairly standard theme park grub, but there are a couple of stand outs such as Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream parlour (I recommend the peanut butter and strawberry ice cream sundae), Voodoo Donuts (which is actually just outside the park on Citywalk), and the frozen butter beer from the Fountain of Fair Fortune.  We ended up spending a lot longer at Universal Studios than we anticipated because we also had tickets for Halloween Horror Nights which made the visit unforgettable!  I cannot wait to go back next year and jump on all the rides again!"
620,2018-1,"For anyone 7 years + thus is a great park, majority of rides are simulated adventures, over family had an amazing time. We can easily say this park was our favourite even over Disney. Staying at a universal hotel gave us quick access to park with no additional parking fees.  We thoroughly enjoyed every ride and the new harry potters section is so cool (I’m not a Harry Potter fan).  Will definitely be back."
621,2018-1,were hoping to be coming back this year to this fabulous place we are bringing with us the whole family as we want them to experience this fantastic brilliant uplifting place we love it i urge every one visit at least once you will not regret it
622,2018-1,"Universal Studios was fun, a lot to see and extremely crowded. We allowed ourselves a full 12 hour day for the one park and discovered that we could of used even more time to do everything that we would of like to do. Some people paid extra to jump the line and if you have children or teens I would recommend this even though it does cost more. As any park bring your wallet!"
623,2018-1,"I just read the review of the person who was complaining about the Fear Factor eating contest. All I can say is that I did it too, and it was great. I don't know what was wrong with that person who wrote the review, but it sounds like somebody who's a whiny baby. The milk was not actually sour, and it was mostly fish, and insects are good for you, as there are countries everywhere who eat them as their source of protein. There was nothing in that mixture that would have hurt anybody. They say what they say to get the ick factor from the audience, and it's all part of the show. If you can't handle something like that, then you shouldn't bother to enter the contest. It's called Fear Factor for a reason. The park was great, and I enjoyed my day, but entering the Fear Factor contest was the highlight of my day. It's true that all you win is a cup with free refills, but just being part of it was worth it. Right after that contest, I went and got on a roller coaster. It didn't turn my stomach at all."
624,2018-1,"Love universal, best parks in Orlando. Great rides, something for everyone.  Can't wait to return next year."
625,2018-1,"When we visited we were only supposed to go for 2 days but ended up going an extra 5 times during our 2 week stay. I have nothing bad to say about the parks. We went to universal, island of adventure and volcano bay. Because of coronavirus we have had to cancel our holiday for this year but are using the money to come back to universal next year. We are hoping to stay at one of their hotels because this also looked amazing. I would highly suggest buying the Coca Cola refill. You can have anything from water to fizzy drinks. Can’t wait to ride the Mummy again next year"
626,2018-1,Lots of amazing rides- especially simulator rides which was perfect for me as I don’t like rollercoasters. The theming is great and there is so much to see. Tickets are very pricey however you do get lots of rides for this. I did this and Islands of Adventure in one day so took the hogwarts express to here. The refill drink is worth the money. The shopping is great and we loved the shows. The park is so much quieter than Disney apart from the Harry Potter parts. These have such brilliant theming. Tip It takes over 10 mins to walk to where Lyft/Uber can pick you up so allow time for this. The espresso passes meant we did not queue for anything! You will have to sue free lockers for some rides to leave your bags but these are easy to use.
627,2018-1,"What an amazing day we had here, a group of six, we all really enjoyed our day at Universal Studios. Having not visited the park in six years we were excited to see what was new. We enjoyed the Fast & the Furious ride as it put us right in the center of the action. This park has fantastic roller coasters, characters, shows and street performances. The Diagon Alley area in the Harry Potter park is fantastic, where every little detail is spot on. There are also a lot of simulator type rides which are fabulous. There are lot of different food options spread throughout the park, so plenty of choice. Our favorite part of this visit was the Mardi Gras Parade, the costumes and the floats were breathtaking. There were so many beads being thrown into the crowd, we came home with heaps. A fantastic experience!"
628,2018-1,"We visited Universal in January. We purchased the hopper pass solely for the Harry Potter Hogwart Exress between the parks. In addition the one experience we wanted to see was Jurassic Park. First of all, Jurassic Park was closed for updating. We accepted this, but it wasn’t noted prior to purchasing our tickets. Next, the Hogwart Express was closed for planned maintenance, which is solely the only reason we purchased a hopper pass. There were other issues as well. The absolute inexcusable issue is that these items were sent to Universal in a letter in January. As of yet, we have not received a response to our concerns. Consumers deserve the respect of a response."
629,2018-1,What a place!! There is so much to see and do! There is plenty to do and see for all ages. Staff are so friendly and very helpful. The Harry Potter section is well worth a visit only problem is you can not enter Hogwarts school. You can not walk around it as it is a ride. The prices have increased while we were there so bare that in mind and it is $25 for parking.
630,2018-1,"An amazing holiday that is fun for everyone. There is so much to do there, from roller coasters to live performances on stage. Definitely going back!"
631,2018-1,"I went with my 33-year old daughter and her dad, and we had way more fun than we expected. There is so much to see and do; we were there for three days and it wasn't enough time. My favorite part of the park was the Harry Potter section. Even though I'm not a Potter superfan I still truly enjoyed that place. My only complaint and the reason I gave Universal Studios four stars is they need a shuttle service. Even though our hotel dropped us off at the entrance of the park, you then have a VERY, VERY,LONG walk to get to the main park entrance. After a long day that walk seemed even longer!"
632,2018-2,"I’ve never seen a theme park like this one! You could spend every day here for a week and still not see it all! Wizarding World of HP was hands down my favorite. I enjoyed the Jurassic Park section also. I would love to see them offer cheaper tickets for smaller areas (passes strictly to Wizarding World, etc). Also, we stayed at a Universal hotel and despite taking the shuttle it was a LONG walk from the drop off location to Wizarding World! They need some kind of in park transportation?!"
633,2018-2,"We were in Florida for the last two weeks of February. We enjoyed a three day park to park passport at Universal Studios. This gave us a day at each of the attractions. We also purchased the Fast Pass, as I have a disability that made waiting in lines painful. This was well worth the cost, as we spent little time in lines. The park was clean, bright, a little loud for my taste, but it didn't bother my son or husband. We enjoyed everything we could squeeze in each day. The rides/attractions are very interesting and fun, though my son was too large for all of the Harry Potter rides on both sides of the train ride, and that was the main reason that he went to Universal.He has Autism, and this was very distressing for him. We found lots of various souvenirs to purchase, including our family crests and histories! My son worked on his key chain collection, and managed to get several items from the Harry Potter collection for his ""House"". We had a fabulous time, tried all different kinds of food, went on wonderful rides and attractions, saw amazing things, and can't wait to come back?"
634,2018-2,"Where to begin! This place was incredible....The rides, the ambience, was all incredible. Less expensive than Disney, but really geared toward teens and above, a truly memorable vacation. Even being there when it was too hot and humid at that time, we still had a blast. Tips for travelers; the Universal Pass or staying in a hotel on property that offers the Universal Pass will really save you from standing in line too long."
635,2018-2,"We returned to Universal Studios Florida for a third time to experience Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure ride, and it didn't disappoint! We've remained nothing but impressed at the detail of the attractions, there. We're consummately smitten with the Harry Potter attractions, but it doesn't stop there. This trip, we also braved Hurricane Dorian as it hit landfall. Fortunately, we were able to fly out before it got too bad. Extra tip: Try to get to the Leaky Cauldron™ in Diagon Alley™ for their breakfast. It is delicious and plentiful. Whether you want to gorge like Harry and Ron on their fresh scrambled eggs, sausage links, black pudding, English bacon, baked beans, grilled tomato, sautéed mushrooms and breakfast potatoes. Or, stay a 'Merican and dig out on some fresh scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, crisp bacon, and link sausage with butter croissant. The freshly baked flan of apples and oatmeal served with yogurt and fresh seasonal fruit was also a delight."
636,2018-2,"lovely place to walk round, queues a bit long for what we are used to, timing is everything here. kids enjoyed it."
637,2018-2,"Loved it here, even though I am in my late 50s. Didn't do all the ride but the ones I did were great."
638,2018-2,"My husband and I enjoyed our visit to Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure. It is fun to walk around the areas. The food isn't too expensive and the fast food ordering is well organized. The main draw for me was the two Harry Potter areas: Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. I really got into the mood of the movies. The shops are fun to browse, and the shows were entertaining, especially the Beedle the Bard show, which I watches twice. Many of the shows have ASL interpreters. If you are a Simpsons fan, the Simpsons area was very fun, with Lard Lad, Quik-E-Marts, etc. The Simpsons ride was amazing. I almost wish the lines for the attractions were slower because the entertainment in the lines was very amusing. Even though I am too large for the Gringott's ride, the staff was kind enough to recommend that I walk through the line to see Gringott's bank lobby (fabulous) and some little shows along the way. Be sure to stop at the Knight Bus to chat with the shrunken head. The Jurassic Park area was very clever. It is next to Hogsmeade, so we went from one John Williams theme to another. There were lots of benches to sit on, some in the shade. Lots of walking just to get from the parking garage to the entrance of the park. To save money on drinks, bring a water bottle. There are drinking fountains near the restrooms."
639,2018-2,I had a very great experience with my family. Even though we had to walk a lot we really enjoyed it and I recommend for you to go on a family vacation with the people you love here.
640,2018-2,"Universal is a full day out. The rides are mainly geared towards children 8+ and adults.  Parking is easy and costs $25, cost covers the whole day. Make a note of your parking space because the lot of huge.  The best area is Harry Potter, we are not fans but thought the area was very well visually designed with a lot to see. It’s easy to miss the entrance to the area, close to Kings Cross train station. Definitely worth trying the Butter beer, it’s sweet with an milkshake texture.  Harry Potter train was very good and recommended. You will need a 2 park ticket as the ride takes you to Adventure island’s park next door.  We didn’t have Express passes and managed to get on most rides easily in a day. Most rides no more than 20-25 mins.  A lot of the rides are 3D or simulator rides. Some great rides include: Transformers- simulator ride while is a very jerky but fun. Mummy - roller coaster in the dark Simpson’s - 3D simulator fun ride Men in black - shooting the Aliens while in a car ET - helping ET escape while on a bike Sherk is a show - good fun  Fast and furious was boring and not worth the wait.  Plenty of places to eat and drink, we chose to wait and eat at City Walk."
641,2018-2,"The parks are always great. We love all of the attractions. The crowds were very low due to the virus. Our trip was interrupted due to the covid 19 outbreak. The parks closed to the public after two days of our nine day trip , and I don't know yet how they are handling the situation. I hope they will honer our passes when we can return. I'll update everyone when I find out anything."
642,2018-2,"Like thousands I had our family spring break vacation planned to start by the week of March 17, and canceled due to the parks closure, and flights cancellations. Had booked Disney and Universal, both tickets and hotels paid in full. Requested refund by March 15th, and Disney + Marriott sent a refund to my credit card by NEXT DAY. Universal (tickets) and Hyatt (room) are still thinking about it 11 DAYS LATER. NO EXPLANATIONS, NO CONTACT.... That's how companies loose customers for good."
643,2018-2,So much to do here. Lots of cool simulated rides. Lots of things to keep you happy all day long. Fun for all ages. Wear some good shoes because lots of walking and bring a disposible poncho in case of rain
644,2018-2,We visited Universal Studios and Island of Adventure. This is the place to go if you are a Harry Potter fan for sure. Great parks and lots of fun. We are seniors and noticed that there are quite a few rides that we couldn't participate in. Since these parks are family oriented and we saw many families with grandparents it would be nice if there was some kind of monitary consideration for them. All in all a great time.
645,2018-2,"Loved going round Universal, they have put a lot of thought and detail into their streets and rides. Spent an extra day (than planned) here as we enjoyed it so much."
646,2018-2,"The classics are still here - Revenge of Mummy, MIB and SImpsons, which now has been expaded to include eateries. Linked by the Hogwarts express to I of A there is the Gringotts ride to give you a taster of HP - its a great ride! Rip Ride for the daring - 100% virtical rise and a drop that will literally take you off your seat!! It's quieter here than I of A - so you can pretty much do everythnig you wish. But what is Fast & Furious all about - how can Vin Diesel be larger than a helicopter????"
647,2018-2,"I was shocked at how disgustingly dirty this park was. When one pays as much as one does for admission, you at least expect the restroom trash bins to be emptied. They were overflowing, the sanitary bins in the stalls were stuffed and overflowing, there was urine on the floor - and the ""Sharps"" bin was full to overflowing. Just nasty."
648,2018-2,"This park is all types of fun, friendly staff and a ton of things to see. I enjoyed all the things they offered. Universal has spared no expense when it comes to quality. The paved roads, the buildings, bathrooms, automatic runway, food, attractions and staff was top quality."
649,2018-2,"We had such a great time taking a group of 160 students from Texas there last week, and really enjoyed all the rides. My two favorite ones have to be the Rockit, and The Mummy Returns!"
650,2018-2,"Universal used to be my favourite park, however now every single ride is a similar 4D experience -- typically some moving car, 3D screens, and at least one moment where you'll get hit with a squirt of water. Wish they would offer some more varying experiences. Still, the rides are a lot of fun."
651,2018-2,We go to Universal every time we go to Orlando and Disney World. This year we found Universal was a better time by far than Disney.
652,2018-2,"Enjoyed the park but after 5 hours there the 3D rides became too much for us all, majority of rides are 3D and it just a bit much but that said some of them are awesome"
653,2018-3,AMZING great place to go family friendly would go again the foods good the hotels clean. Most magical place in earth
654,2018-3,"Just like adventure island this park is all types of fun, friendly staff and a ton of things to see. We were lucky enough to be there for the Mardi Gras parade which was spectacular, the music the floats filled with guests from the park all dressed up throwing beads to everyone the amazing dancers and stilt walkers."
655,2018-3,"The big attraction for us was Harry Potter. The park has 2 separate areas devoted to HP:- Hogwarts & Diagon Alley, connected by the Hogwarts express. Firstly the train is very authentic with a different video/window view in each direction - the corridor windows also show images passing. I chickened out on Hagrid's ride the first day, but after other rides I figured I(in my 70s) could handle it if on the bike. Yup, no problem, just watch what is coming ahead. The Quiditch ride purportedly takes guests to the quidditch pitch from the school. It is more a video simulation with tipping & turning. A short segment in the dark does NOT have any violent movements. Diagon Alley is even more of an immersion invert convincing vintage London. The Gringott's ride is excellent. The queue through the bank offers photo ops of an excellent lifelike simulation. The route of the ride is not identical to the movie but similar & therefore fresh. Again a video sim with turning tipping cars. A definite ""don't miss"". The approach from the opening brick wall is the best for pics of the Dragon spouting flame. Schedule - every 10min warning dragon noises to get camera ready. MIB was also very good. Spiderman was well orchestrated but a bit improbable. Transformers was excellent, but so quick changing I would have to do it twice to review. Kong. Oh Kong, we queued for 20 min & left after"" a brief interruption"" changed to long. Later in the day we got to within sight of the cars when it broke down again after an hour in line. Of course we felt cheated when we left."
656,2018-3,"My wife and I are in our late fifties and enjoyed 2 of the 3 Universal Parks. We did not go to Adventure Islands due to time restrictions and prefer beaches instead. This was our first time to Universal but have been to all the Disney parks in the past. My wife is not big on Roller Coasters but she enjoyed all the 3D rides which pleasantly surprised me because for the most part I really enjoyed them also.There were plenty of eating options and the parks there laid out well.There were some long lines but nothing to crazy. I can go on about our favourite rides but that would be a matter of opinion.Suffice to say we feel although it can be quite pricey, we had a great time and felt it was worthwhile experience."
657,2018-3,A visit to this place can certainly turn back the clock as a 62 year old kid once thru the gate I was running about like a teen-ager if you can stay in one of the park hotels worth the extra money because you save on parking and. The free fast pass is invaluable as well as the transport and early entry
658,2018-3,"We went to Universal Orlando for 2 days with a park hopper pass. We had fun but less so than other parks.  There were some great rides with our favorites being Revenge of the Mummy, Escape from Gringotts and Transformers. However, we found the park relies too much on 3d rides than other parks including Islands of Adventure. You have Jimmy Fallon's Race Through NY, Fast and Furious Supercharged, The Simpsons Ride, Despicable Me Minion Mayhem, Shrek 4D.  If you experience motion sickness, this may not be the best park to go to."
659,2018-3,"I love universal and they nail it. This review is in hopes that they see how unhappy and insulted park goers are by this. I've had a better time passing kidney stones. Get it together, Universal."
660,2018-3,"We spent 14 days in Florida and enjoyed Disney and Universal Studios. As for queue times and the amount of people we found Universal a lot more bearable than the Disney parks.  The new Hagrids coaster was amazing, we knew the queue time was going to be excessive so we got there early as soon as the gates opened. There was already a 90 minute wait at 8.30am so we decided to do the single rider, well worth it if not fused about being with your own party. It is also interesting to see the way thrill rides are heading such as King Kong Skull Island and Fast and the Furious, the King Kong ride was a way better experience than Fast and the Furious, the wait time for this ride was very long and the ending was somewhat disappointing. Harry Potter world is amazing from the characters to the overall land, not to forget the Butterbeer.  We also spent half a day at Volcano Bay which is the new water park. WOW !, this beats Blizzard Beach by far and just a whisker past Typhoon Lagoon. I can imagine during the summer months the queues could be pretty unbearable but the weather played ball for us and we could get on most of the rides within 10 - 20 minute wait. Taputapu is a great idea and I think many theme parks could learn alot from this, you just tap it against the ride you want to do and when you get a reminder just head back to your allotted time, easy !!.  Not only do you get to do a lazy river but you also get a crazy river, which had be be done a couple of times."
661,2018-3,"So we came here because we had a cheer competition to attend and decided we’d make the most of trip and stay at one of Universal’s premier resorts so we could get free express passes to skip the lines. We also purchased Dining passes since there is 5 of us, 3 children and 2 adults which my son son who is 10 is charged as an adult. That is $69.95 per person per day for the full dining plan. We purchased 2 days worth. I thought that would help me save money rather than paying the overpriced food at the park but I wish I just would have paid while at the park because we would have paid less. If you do the math on what I just said for the dining passes it comes up to $700 for 5 people in 2 days. When I added up all the money of what we actually ordered with our passes including some expensive meals at Margaritaville 2 nights in a row with some meals that cost over $20 a pop, it only came up to like $495. So really I feel like I’ve been robbed of $200. It’s all good, I know now. Thanks Universal for everything that you do to overcharge families. Everything else about the trip was great, but I don’t like the feel of not getting my money’s worth or feeling cheated which is what I do in this situation."
662,2018-3,as usually both parks were awesome we made sure to buy the park to park hopper so that we could ride the train back and forth. Hagrids was so very awesome we got to ride it twice and was so worth the wait each time!
663,2018-3,"Everything has been given lots of thought, as far as people's needs. Lots of food, hotels, and the rides are fantastic. Lots of good suveniers. Staff very helpful."
664,2018-3,Universal Orlando was lots of fun and the rides are awesome. All of the Harry Potter attractions are top-notch and very authentic.
665,2018-3,"Found this was more of an adult oriented park I loved the 3D aspect of all the rides that I went on although I would have gone on the big roller coasters if I was younger.The Harry Potters Diagon Alley and the train ride to Hogsmeade to Hogwarts was excellent ,also found the food choices much better than Disney.Make sure you get the fast passes on your ticket as it cuts out waiting in line,expensive but worth it."
666,2018-3,"We traveled with three teens. The Harry Potter fans could have spent both days in Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley. It is detailed and true to the books. Hagrid’s ride was everyone’s favorite and limes were reasonable over the lunch hour. The child who is not a Potter fan rode roller coasters instead. However, there are not many real roller coasters at these two parks. Most of the rides are 3D simulations. One kid liked them but the rest of us got tired of it after a while. There is plenty to do and see for two days. Take ear plugs. The story set ups in the lines are loud, the sound effects on the rides are loud, even the roller coasters have speakers blasting music in the car (when did roller coasters start needing music to make it fun?). We left the park and ate at City Walk and that is loud, too. The light show at Hogwarts is fantastic"
667,2018-3,Worst experience of my life. Rude staff. Long waits for attractions. Seems like miles between hand sanitizer
668,2018-3,"We love Universal. Have visited several times now, and it never gets old. The lines weren't overly long, which was great. We skipped the Transformers ride as the wait was super long, and had to wait longer than expected for Fast and Furious as it broke down temporarily while we waited in line. The ride wasn't even that exciting when it was all said and done. We left it feeling like that was it? We really enjoyed the shows at the park. Make time to watch the Beat Builders, Fear Factor Live and The Horror Makeup Show. Highly recommend the Makeup Show, not at all like it sounds but hilarious.. The host and guest were very funny, and made it worthwhile. We also watched the parade and checked out the Tribute store which was a nice new added feature."
669,2018-3,"WOW! What an amazing theme park. I was here with my husband and three children in February 2020. We had a 5-day multi-park Universal pass, and we still didn't get to see and do everything we wanted to because there is just so much fun to be had! We already can't wait to go back.  Highlights: - If you like thrill rides, you will not be disappointed! Don't miss the Hulk coaster. My husband and I are huge roller coaster fans and we have been on dozens all over Canada and the US. We even got engaged on a roller coaster! The Hulk coaster ranks right up there with the best of them because of its speed and duration. - The Harry Potter World is beyond what I could have imagined. My two older children and I are huge Harry Potter fans, and we had been told that the park was incredible, but it's even better that I was expecting. It's just like stepping into the movies or books. Everything down to the last detail has been thought of and is themed exactly as it should be. And the rides too, WOW! - There was plenty for my youngest child to do too (age 2). She enjoyed meeting all of the characters, and I liked that we didn't have to wait in a huge line to meet them unlike at Disney World! There are also plenty of surprisingly fun smaller rides for young children. - The child swap system is genius! It allows you to ride the big thrill rides even if you have a small child with you. You simply split your group in half, and while the first half enjoys the ride, the others wait in a comfortable air-conditioned room. Then, you get to swap places and the second half of your group gets on the ride without waiting in line again. It worked like a charm every time, and the child swap rooms always had some sort of movie playing or other entertainment to keep kids from getting restless. They even featured water fountains and change tables. A lot of thought and planning went into the child swap system and it was definitely appreciated! - Despite being fairly busy, we were amazed at how quickly the line ups moved for all the rides. Even better is that almost all of the longer line ups featured themed entertainment along the way, so the waits were much more enjoyable. - Even with heavy use, the restrooms were always surprisingly clean and well stocked. They even smelled nice! - The food in the park is a bit pricey, but there are lots of options available and some of them are quite reasonable. We found several good places to eat, all with different menu options and themes. If you want to pay a bit less, walk across to City Walk and you'll find great quick-eats options. - The staff at Universal's parks were incredible. Everyone was friendly and helpful, and one performer from the Mardi Gras celebration even went out of her way to dance with and entertain my toddler! My daughter was absolutely thrilled.  Overall, my family was so impressed with everything at Universal Orlando. It was just non-stop fun and we cannot wait to go back!"
670,2018-3,Visited Universal Orlando park for 3 days last week. The park was not to crowded but the temperatures were in the 90 degree range for 2 of the 3 days. We are not coaster riders and high speed ride types but all of the other rides were really enjoyable. The Harry Potter sections of the park were the most enjoyable and consumed the majority of our visit. Overall a fantastic visit and am looking to return sometime in the future with the grandchildren.
671,2018-3,We were at both parks at Universal last week. The CDC is stating that hand washing is important in the fight against the Coronavirus. I was surprised that there was no hot water in the restrooms in either park that our family visited.
672,2018-3,"Had not been in 15 years, and took my 8 year old son for first visit. Unlike Disney, didn't have to say excuse me 15 millions times a day. Crowd was busy, but not uncomfortable. Food underwhelming, but City Walk restaurants looked tasty. Loved all the virtual simulator rides to enjoy as a family! Looking forward to Islands of Adventure visit over Spring Break!"
673,2018-3,Universal & Island of Adventure provide fun attractions for all the family and is a must if visiting Orlando.
674,2018-4,Was pretty pricey for Canadians due to the exchange rate. $382 on short notice with exchange. Enjoyed the day but been there done that kind of visit!
675,2018-4,"My mom and I always love seeing the Animal Actors on Location show whenever we are at Universal Orlando. Not only is it such a great show, but the team members who greet and help get you seated are always so outstanding, especially Georgiana. She’s so wonderful with both children and adults, always going above and beyond to make sure you have a good time, even before the show gets started. Her customer service skills are top notch. Kudos to your company for hiring such a phenomenal individual."
676,2018-4,This was our first trip to universal studios. Definitely a different feel from WDW. Could definitely do US and island adventure in one day with the express pass. Grounds are not as clean as WDW and just not as many rides. My teens and I prefer Disney.
677,2018-4,"This is a world class attraction with an amazing adventure between in the Harry Potter worlds. If possible, you need two days at these parks and you need a two park pass to experience everything. My only warning is that during Mardi Gras they charge for Valet, even for Premium Annual Pass holders and it is a NIGHTMARE trying to get your car at the end of the day! You are way better off walking to the parking garage (save time and money)."
678,2018-4,A great day out in the Universal park. Always love the vibe you get from entering the park and the amazing staff that meet you at the entrance. Lots to see and do.
679,2018-4,We decided to take our grandson to Universal Studios for his seventh birthday. What a great choice! We all had a wonderful time. The park is very well run! Strongly urge the express pass. It is well worth the investment!
680,2018-4,"My sister & I met here for my birthday & had the most wonderful time! I had never been here before, but will absolutely come back here before I return to any of the other area theme parks. The whole complex (all 3 parks) is the best, & I particularly enjoyed this particular park."
681,2018-4,"Loved the park and rides! However, we found the IT department was struggling today and if not for well-trained guest relations people we would have turned around and left. I bought tickets online the night before and got email delivery. We went straight to the gates as the tickets instructed and were told they were blocked and to go to guest services. Jasmine was our amazing representative and she went by the book taking care of us and realizing the computer infrastructure was causing our issues. After 20 minutes and two calls to the IT department we were in our way. Then at our first ride, it was apparent the e-ticket image wouldn’t open the lockers you are forced to use. We had to go to an attendant to get a ticket to use. What’s the point in issuing the e-tickets if they aren’t going to work. We’d love to go back but next time it’s paper tickets."
682,2018-4,"I decided to take my wife and three daughters (6, 4, and 18 mo) here for an extended weekend trip and we had a blast. We stayed at Loews Royal Pacific for three nights and spent three days in the parks. We used Xpress Passes and park hoppers which allowed us to experience everything multiple times and meet most of the characters. There was something to do for the whole family. The best part is that there’s a child swap room for every attraction, so it doesn’t matter if you have small ones who can’t ride. They can relax and hangout right off the loading area. That’s a big deal for families.  We held the Disney annual pass for a year and visited all the parks many times. Somehow it always resulted in frustration at their guest service, construction, crowds, fastpass system, and so on. We would be exhausted before we even entered the park. Not at Universal! No rides were down and no glitches that caused us precious time spent at guest services. As far as transportation goes, water taxi was able to get us in the park in less than 20 minutes from our resort. Fantastic. To receive this level of service at Disney, you would need to spend at least 20K on top of being in their vacation club.  I feel that we definitely got our money’s worth at Universal and this will be our new family destination. My kids are still talking about our trip and are already planning for next year!"
683,2018-4,"Universal studios has got to be my favourite place to visit in Orlando Florida. I am a huge Simpsons fan and visiting Springfield USA was beyond mind blowing. I love the interactive atmosphere, the Duff brewery, the kwikie mart, Krusty land, And so many of the loveable restaurants from the TV show are there and feature some pretty good eats. I love the fact that you can get the big pink donut with sprinkles add lard lad.  The characters are so friendly and it’s great to get your picture taken with so many fan favourite individuals like Scooby Doo, the Penguins, Poppy and The Simpsons.  The wizard in world of Harry Potter really feels like you were in the movie sets and you believe where you are to be real. The shops the food, the experience was mine blowing for my Harry Potter fans in the family and it something they will definitely remember for the rest of their lives. The parks are clean And very safe to walk around with great concessions and washrooms available almost everywhere."
684,2018-4,Was my first Blue Man group show. I was entertained for the most part except for a short twinkies skit in the middle. I would recommend this show if you have never seen one but personally I think once would be enough for me.
685,2018-4,"Good street entertainment, excellent novelty gifts, especially the Harry Potter areas. Rides and sections for all ages."
686,2018-4,"Diagon Alley in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is the best part of this park; it is amazing!! If you love Harry Potter then definitely make the trip! Unfortunately, the rest of the park is pretty boring. The theming is very out of date. Many of the rides are based on movies that are 20-30 years old and today’s generation doesn’t even know what they are. Also, the screen and 3D ride concept here is extremely overused. This park needs more up to date theming and actual theme park rides."
687,2018-4,"This was our 3rd visit. We always have to visit Harry Potter World. We did spend more time in Dr. Seuss than usual, the book store and a couple of rides. The weather was perfect and the crowds minimal. The best part, because of where we stayed we got the express pass. That pass is worth every penny! Pricey but we were in and out of rides in quick time, even on the days more people were coming. We could have done it all in 2 days but stretched it to 3."
688,2018-4,"Well... I don't know where should I start beacouse too many amazing things happened whid me at the park. The rides were crazy! I visited the ""adventure park"" and my favourite ride was the Jurassic Park ride but all of them was amazing! I also bought Hermione Granger's wand beacouse I am a Harry Potter fanatic. I also really want to celebrate my birthday in the park whid my classmates but unfortunately I am not form Orlando so it is impossible. But I will check other parks out whid my family, I just can't skip them. Thank you for these amazing, Unforgettable memories! I will never forget them 😍💕"
689,2018-4,I think universal is better than Disney world. At least for adults. Higher intensity rides. Both parks are amazing. Islands of adventure is the better of the two parks in my opinion. Obviously everything is over priced but that is to be expected. Very good restaurants on site throughout both parks. Highly recommend going during the offseason when kids are in school. I have two kids and we just pulled them out for a week. SOOOOOO worth it. Lines were minimal. I think the longest we waited for any ride was about 40 mins. And that was without fast passes. The entire experience is so much better when its not crowded. We went the last week of January.
690,2018-4,"We loved the 8 hour private VIP tour. Our guide, Taylor, made our day perfect. We booked the tour so my elderly father wouldn’t have to wait in lines. Taylor worked tirelessly to make sure we had a perfect day, planned just for our needs and personality. The ability to ride whatever we wanted without waiting was awesome! The day also included three huge, very nice meals. We recommend using the restaurant vouchers for the Chocolate Imporium because they don’t limit their menu. Lambardi’s limits what you can order with the meal voucher, and considering the cost of the day, that was unacceptable."
691,2018-4,"Visited with my 10yr old and my 15yr old. This was my daughters double digits birthday trip. Absolutely the best time to come!! Because we stayed at a universal hotel we were able to get into the park an hour early. Unfortunately most attractions didn’t open until 9 so it was kind of a bust. However we were able to do minions immediately. The park was not as busy as it normally is during peak season. With that being said we hit the attractions 3 times with less than ten minute waits. My youngest daughters favorites mummy, minions, Jimmy Fallon, transformers. My oldest loved them as well but really enjoyed the Rip Ride Rocket. She went on alone and it was fine. We would definitely come back again."
692,2018-4,"Really enjoyed Universal Studios lots to see and do loved Kong Skull Island, some of the food options were not that great wish they had more characters walking around didn’t see to many Harry Potter World was pretty cool"
693,2018-4,"there are some really cool rides, but many of the new updates Harry Potter rides went down a lot! in both Universal and Islands of adventure. That was very frustrating especially when you look forward to riding something and you can not because it's down for the day. The Staff on the other hand, if I 4-5 staff smart mouth me and my friend for no reason at all! If I was rude or not following directions that still wouldnt happen at Disney, but we are in our late 30's and just had a quiet girls trip and gave no reason to be talked to rudely. Gonna be a while before we think about visiting Universal again."
694,2018-4,"Strolled around the park entrance, sightseeing, no tickets needed. Plenty of shops, restaurants, clubs, and vendors."
695,2018-5,We just finished two and a half days here. We loved the parks overall. I need a bit of help with mobility and everyone was more than willing to help with assisting me. That being said be aware there is a serious lack of benches in both parks. It was hot both days and there is a lack of affordable water options especially in the wizarding world of Harry Potter. The rides were wonderful! Characters remained in character the entire time we saw them interacting. On the Universal side a few more bathrooms would be nice. If you have young children take advantage of those bathrooms.
696,2018-5,"Islands of Adventure is a great park to spend a day. My wife and I went early on a Sunday in February. Not crowded, maybe a 20 minute wait for the Hulk roller coaster - which, btw, is a ridiculous thrill ride, glad I did it, would never do it again! (but that's just me). I love the references to old cartoon characters throughout the park and there are super heroes around every corner for the kids (and kids at heart).  The park was not crowded until the afternoon at the Harry Potter Hogsmeade town which is the most popular area. Loved the Popeye raft ride (you WILL get soaked!) The Jurassic Park River Adventure was another highlight. The detail in the Harry Potter Hogswart castle is amazing.  We ate lunch at Captain America Diner because they had the Impossible burger for my wife. I had a regular burger which was pretty tasteless and way overpriced.  The shopping is pretty good - if you're a comic book buff, they have a great store for that with great prices. All in all, a great day and you can easily take in the whole Islands of Adventure area in one day.  We didn't bother with the express passes and really didn't need them - longest line was Harry Potter - but I can see how they may be worth it if the park is more crowded."
697,2018-5,"Definitely recommend getting the multi-park ticket so you can go between Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley! The Hogwarts Express train ride is fantastic and great for all ages! We loved all of the rides, unfortunately the new Hagrid Motorbike ride wasn't working but everything else was so much fun! My daughter had a memorable wand experience in the wand shop and this was a wonderful family trip!"
698,2018-5,The park is very fun. However I would never go with fast passes again. But better save up it’s not cheap. I wish it was more affordable because I did not plan that much extra in the trip budget. Minimal rides due to long long lines. But know better for next time.
699,2018-5,"So much fun for kids and us. The lines were not too long, except 1 attraction. it was our 3 time and kids still want to come back again."
700,2018-5,"Was in Orlando for a trade show in Orange County Convention Centre.  Decided to unwind after show was finished and on the first “free day” went to park with a colleague.  Weather was brilliant. Great fun and craic. Tested our fear boundaries on the Rockit, were transformed into Minions, and overall had a superb time before getting g he train to Island of Adventure.  Only complaint was it is so expensive."
701,2018-5,The two Harry Potter parks are a wonder and the train ride between them is not to be missed both ways. Waited hours to try to ride the Hagrid Motorbike Adventure only to have it break down time after time. Spiderman and Hulk Coaster among many great attractions at these amazing parks.
702,2018-5,This was our first time to visit. Seems like we could stand at the entrance and almost see the whole park which is so different than what we were used to at Disney. We experienced every attraction and were finished by 1:30.
703,2018-5,Amazing rides for all with enough to keep you going all day! Universal always keeps the wheels going with new attractions.
704,2018-5,one of my best day ever universal one of the past parks in Orlando and Disney world I like it more than Disney
705,2018-5,"It was raining and a cool side. We started with ""Despicable Me"" then we stopped at ""Jimmy Fallen"". As we continued to walk we also enjoyed ""Transformers"", ""E.T."" and other enjoyable rides at Universal Studios. Then we took train over to ""Island of Adventures"" to ride ""Harry Potter"", ""Spiderman"" and ""King ""Kong"". These are just a few rides filled with fun. Although it rained a little, a light jacket was needed. We had a nice time."
706,2018-5,We did not go there it was very expensive for us. To go there for two people you have to expect to spend at least four hundred dollars to do the park.
707,2018-5,"great park experience, plenty to do in each park. no need for park jumper ticket. unless you want to ride on the Hogwarts express"
708,2018-5,"Impossible to see it also in one day so get multi day or if you live close enough go for the annual pass. We have the annual passes and it’s so nice to be able to go whenever we want and don’t have to rush. Everybody knows about the attractions and rides, but I think the quality of restaurants for a theme park is probably the best around, which many people don’t know. Expensive, but so is everything in theme parks. Anything you can think of can be found between city walk and in the parks. Hulk coaster is probably my favorite ride. The water rides are awesome on a hot summer day but unless you’re wearing quick dry clothing save them for the end or you’ll be walking around wet and miserable because FL humidity isn’t gonna dry your clothes anytime soon. They do have giant dryers for people to stand in for a price but you’re not gonna be dry if you’re wearing jeans or any heavy fabric. Overall, I highly recommend."
709,2018-5,"I had a decent time at Universal Studios. I paid extra for the park to park ticket so that I could ride on the Hogwarts Express and I would suggest doing that. The replica of Hogsmede, Hogwarts and Diagon Alley were impressive and the primary reason I went. I did find that the theme park overall was very much geared towards getting you to spend money with more shops with overpriced items and restaurants than rides. In order to leave every ride, you have to walk through the gift shop associated with that ride. The rides are primarily 4d with lots of video effects. I was disappointed that the lightshow on Hogwarts did not run and no one notified attendees that it was cancelled so a lot of people spent over an hour waiting for it.  Note: When either park closes, you cannot ride the train to the other park that remains open."
710,2018-5,"This is an awesome place for Harry Potter fans!!! There is Diagon Alley in the Universal Studios part - then “hop” on over to Islands of Adventure to Hogsmead. We have season passes - but if you go with regular tickets, make sure you get the park-to-park tickets that allow you to transfer between parks so you can take the train!  This place is completely different from Disney in terms of the rides - lots of simulator rides."
711,2018-5,"Did the VIP tour- THE BEST EXPERIENCE EVER!!! No waiting in line, lunch was included- they really went above and beyond. Great if you only do a one day ticket and are short on time or just want to skip the lines. EXCELLENT PARK!!"
712,2018-5,"In my personal opinion the actual rides are definitely more appealing and exhilarating than a majority of the rides in Universals neighbouring Disney parks. However, compared to Disney slick design across their entire repertoire of parks, Universal just doesn't cut the mustard. 90% of the set design amd production of the park seems very basic; a wooden cutout on a painted background just doesn't cut it anymore, and the characters walking around the park look like they're wearing a budget costume you could find in your everyday supermarket on the lead up to Halloween"
713,2018-5,"My husband and I just returned from 5 fun-filled days at Universal Orlando. I've been on a ketogenic diet (low carb/high fat) for seizure control for more than 5 years. I was concerned when I looked at their online menus bc everything is high carb. I emailed Universal prior to going and asked about keto options and never got a reply so I packed my KetoVie just in case there was nothing I could eat. Turns out I didn't have to be concerned. Starbucks prepared my 2/3 coffee, 1/3 heavy whipping cream every morning. At the on-site restaurants (Leaky Cauldron, 3 Broomsticks) I learned that when you order the cashiers/waitstaff at Universal can not stray from the printed menu items but will gladly call for a head cook (who knows whats in the food) to come out and discuss your needs with you and have the food prepared just for you. I have been on keto so long that I follow rules and don't need explicit carb counts so if you are counting carbs it might be a problem. For example, at the 3 Broomsticks I ordered the American breakfast and they substituted bacon, sausage, and sauteed mushrooms for the potatoes and bread. They did the same for me at Citywalk's BigFire restaurant where I had delicious grilled brussel sprouts, grilled mixed veggies, and trout. My order included only the veggies I can eat - no picking out potatoes, carrots etc... BigFire had lots on their menu I could eat and the food was delightfully fresh and simple."
714,2018-5,"We specifically went here to see Harry Potter World. Which was disappointing (in another review). Outside of that, we went on the water raft ride at Jurassic Park, which was OK. Rest of park was uninteresting. Lots of flashy buildings and shops, only a few rides- coasters and virtual reality rides are painful. Compared to Kings Island in Ohio, this was an overpriced waste of time. We spent most of the morning in Harry Potter, then drifted around to other areas. A lot of walking and not that much to do or see. Pretty Disappointing!!!"
715,2018-5,Universal is great for those looking for thrill rides. Line ups are not bad at all! Arrive early and you'll be able to get through the rides pretty quickly!
716,2018-6,"We've been going to Universal Studios Orlando at least once, sometimes twice a year for the past 12 years ... Our most recent trip in Feb 2020 will be our last. The employees at the parks have been consistently rude, disrespectful, and condescending each and every time. The first few times, I thought maybe it was just a fluke, that they were just having a bad day. But now that these interactions have happened every single time, I know now that the issue is a company-wide one. They aren't trained properly in how to interact with guests. You can't ask any of them a question without them instantly getting defensive.  We had a particularly negative experience this last time while in line for Hagrid's in the Harry Potter area. We saw several families with small children heading into the single rider's line, so after waiting an hour in line with our two whining kids, we decided to follow suit. Our mistake. A 20-something female employee with shoulder-length black hair promptly informed us that line was closed, that ""all those other people were going to the restroom"" and that we needed to ""head back to the end of the line because cutting is bad and I can kick you out of the park for that."" Those were her EXACT words. WE DIDN'T EVEN ASK TO CUT IN LINE! We were 100% cordial/pleasant after realizing our mistake. She just automatically said that to us!! ""Cutting is bad."" And she exaggerated every syllable in such a condescending tone. I've never been spoken to like that by anyone in my entire life. She spoke to us like we were troublemakers trying to get away with something. And while we walked back to the exit, she GLARED at us. GLARED. This was at 10:15am ... we hadn't even gone on a single ride yet. And it really bothered us the rest of the day to be spoken to like that by a Universal employee when we'd made an honest mistake and hadn't been snippy with her in the slightest. Maybe all the families before us made the same error we did and some of them had bit her head off so maybe she expected we were going to do the same, but we were 100% pleasant and she came at us with such a hostile, defensive tone right off the bat. Completely unacceptable!  We've had several other unpleasant interactions with staff over the years, but this last one takes the cake. It has left such a bad taste in our mouth and we won't hesitate to tell our friends/family about this disgusting experience.  From now on, we're sticking strictly with Disney parks. Those employees are happy, pleasant, and speak to guests in a courteous manner regardless of the situation. You can tell the employees at Universal hate their jobs, are annoyed at the tourists, and don't want to be there.  If we're dropping thousands of dollars on a vacation, we want to guarantee a good time. From now on it's Disney for this theme park loving family."
717,2018-6,We came here with our teenagers and they loved it. A lot of walking but very clean and nice. Plenty to do and lots of food places.
718,2018-6,We brought our tickets at our hotel as not staying for two weeks. Deal was for park to park and we got 4 days for the price of 3. This means we can visit any of the 3 parks on the same day and get the hogwarts express. Parking is 24 dollars a day so bear that in mind Universal I have to say is much better that Disney far more choice of restaurants and better laid out. Amazing Harry Potter area and rides were incredible. We queued for around 25 mins to over and hour for each ride but that can be more at busier time’s. avoid spring break Easter and thanks giving All rides at universal really good and lots of variety of rides for youg children’s to terrifying rollercoasters. meal at Chicago rock cafe really good and free re fills We stayed for Mardi Gras parade so glad we did as excellent lots of fun with the floats throwing necklaces great vibe. there is also a firework display on the lake. Restrooms spotless and staff helpful. Would definitely come back great memories made !
719,2018-6,My wife and I have seasonal passes and regularly go there to spend the day. The park is always clean. I have never encountered a negative or rude staff member. The rides are well maintained. The atmosphere is fun and upbeat. This is well worth the price of a ticket or a pass...
720,2018-6,"Visited here for one day, the awe this park offers never dies, would highly recommend a visit here, even if you have been before."
721,2018-6,"No comparation with LA Universal studios, Knowing LA, bad surprise. All working arround. No transport facilities. Harry Potter and 4D cinema acceptable."
722,2018-6,We really enjoyed these parks.... in particular the Harry Potter ride..... Hagrids motorbike ride is stunning.... well worth the 2 to 3 hour wait plus the occasional breakdowns.  Lots of great food offerings but all are expensive..... even an ice cream cost $5 ......  Just couldn't get over the amount of eye for detail these guys put in to everything they do.  Highly recommended this Park...... buy your tickets well in advance and you will get 2 weeks roaming ticket for around £330...... past passes are available on the day if the queues are long at £60 each.....  Stunning.
723,2018-6,"We enjoyed our day at universal studios. Our top picks of the rides would be the rip rockin rollercoaster, the mummy ride and escape from gringotts. The most impressive part of the park though is the Wizarding world of Harry Potter, this is a big area that’s completely obscured from the rest of the park, it’s clever how they’ve done it. The area is so well created, it really feels like you are there. The dragon breathing fire every 15 minutes is a great touch too. We spent a long time just exploring this area and taking it all in. Be sure to look up the “hidden gems” too, which includes things like using the phone box to call the ministry of magic. We would also recommend fear factor live, this was great for us because my wife and son volunteered and got to take part in shooting water cannons at the contestants. One thing to avoid though is the fast and furious ride, we went through it once and the ride didn’t activate, the second time around it did and it was pretty awful, not sure why this one is there. We went on all of the other rides and they were good too, the majority of the other rides are immersive and interactive. Overall we had a great day at the park, would recommend."
724,2018-6,"Our family LOVES Universal! Here are the favourites for us... Harry Potter World (all of the rides, the feel of the area, the Hogwarts Express between the two parks, and the dragon), Transformers, Shrek, Minions, Marvel everything, the Simpsons, and MIB.  The food options are great! The parades are fun for the entire family. Unlike Disney the characters properly interact with the kids and will stand still for a photo op where you don't have to buy a photo package.  Wait to purchase the Express Pass until the day of your visit. If the park isn't packed, then you may not need it. Here is the comparison of Express Pass vs Disney's Fast Pass. Because Disney allows you to select your Fast Pass uses up to 60 days in advance you may not really get the fast pass experience for a lot of rides. The day we went we could only use fast pass for 2 rides. Universal has Disney beat on this where all of the rides (except for the new Hagrid's Motorbike) are eligible for Express Pass. It is so much more value and simple to use than the Disney system which is prone to a disappointing experience.  At Universal there is just so much to do and it is fun for all ages!"
725,2018-6,"Just left Universal and stayed at the resort with all the bells and whistles. Spent a decent amount to get fast pass, early admission, added on character breakfast and dinners and meal plan and Harry Potter breakfast. Talk about a disorganized place. I would have thought Universal just opens last week. The Harry Potter Breakfast is no other benefit other than prepaying for your breakfast, no reserved table just another line to wait in for your “reserved” time. I must have missed that in the fine print. The meal plan is not worth purchasing because numerous cashiers throughout the park do not know how to scan the card correctly and if you do not pay close attention you will get charged for a meal like we did on 4 cards instead of drinks. But they only printed 3 receipts so we made the mistake of thinking the 4 th card was ok, nope. After wasting 45 minutes of waiting for them to fix the cards the first time instead of using that time waiting on Hagrids motorbike when it was actually open. I found out at lunch that I did not have a lunch left and the manager advised me that I could take the it to guest services to have it corrected. So know we are looking at close to 159 minute wait time for hagrids and I walk down to guest services only to be greeted by the girl at the counter stating they only take valid park complaints with a valid picture ID. Like really-really? I am staying on their property with $5000. + package and my room key is my fast pass that is connected to my picture, and my paper ticket for five days is linked to my finger print(which funny enough only worked half the time- would get in the front gate walk to the train and they would have no record of me getting in the park that day) and my separate meal plan card. I figured since I was staying at a park hotel and had my finger print daily and picture and not planning on any trouble, the ID would be ok in the safe. So at this point I could not stay calm. After getting slightly loud and being told without and ID they would do nothing for me and not get me a manager, my demanding to speak to a manager on the 4 th time worked. Really Universal what happened to customer service? You now have a pissed off customer that will did not spend anymore money at your park on his final day and will buy his souvenirs from amazon. All over a $15 meal at most that the manager in the restaurant should have handled the first time but not even the second one could have handled. Yet your guest relations did not want to take my complaint and it was obvious. In the future, I will take my business to Disney. I will not go into my other issues here as I am sure Universal does not care about them either... Beware of the meal. Check your receipts"
726,2018-6,Recommended if you are in Florida. One of the best theme parks in the area. We loved it. What could be better on a hot day seriously?
727,2018-6,"Amazing time in the studio. My daughter so happy, after 3 days she just didnt want to go home. The rides are amazing and staff are so helpful and professional. Harry porter world was just breath taking, not only for kids even we enjoyed so much. Would be back soon with friends. This is a must visit in Florida area."
728,2018-6,This park you will need a couple days to see all the attractions. The food offerings are very good along with the drinks they offer.
729,2018-6,"Wait to buy the Express ticket because it might not be necessary. The park was really empty on the first day we visited it, so the lines were really short. The park was a little busier on the second day we visited, but we still didn’t think it was necessary to purchase the Express ticket. There was 150 minute wait for Hagrid’s Motorbike Adventure, but we did the Single Rider and only waited 40 minutes. We also did Single Rider for Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey and that was only a 30 minute wait. Many of the little kids rides in the Dr. Seuss area of the park had a wait of 5-15 minutes."
730,2018-6,This is a great park that offers alternatives to the usual thrill rides you will find in other places. The rides here are set up like you are part of a movie. My family and I have been here several times; each time there is something different as the rides change. We especially enjoyed the Mummy ride. Plan ahead so you know which rides to go to first and learn how to lower your wait time. The Express Pass is worth it if you are willing to spend the extra $$$.
731,2018-6,Great amusement rides with high attention to detail. It is really an full immersion experience. Everything is clearly marked out and there are a lot of people to assist Take very small bag to store personal belongings and lock in lockers as you go around. If you are into Harry Potter - then there wizarding world is a must see.  We bought the fast pass access. I would say it is essential to enjoy more of the rides.  Tip: The website can be confusing. You need 2 tickets if you want to access the fast pass. The entrance and the fast pass ticket.
732,2018-6,"This was a interesting way to do this park. They have a couple $ of VIP tours. My daughter and I did the cheaper one ( much cheaper unless you have a large group ) includes park to park tickets ( have to have to ride the train ) , wonderful breakfast buffet and a fantastic buffet lunch also. I truly cannot say enough about the food. Depending on what time of year you go prices probably differ. I think a park to park 2 day was about $285.00 for each of us. We paid including tax of everything with tickets for parks was $590.00 each for the VIP tour. Yes that sounds like a lot to many, it was well worth it. Not only do you get to go straight in the back entrance to the rides, shows ,means only maybe 3 minutes of wait time. The biggest problem people might have here is that fact you have NO wait time at all , means you do a heck of a lot more walking than the 98% of the people just standing and waiting, even express pass. Oh which also, when you leave the 5-7 hour tour for the day , you get to use your VIP pass to get thru the express pass....so don’t buy extra express pass. The food would have cost about $50 for this wonderful buffet, ...so breakfast & lunch exquisite taste figure $100 for food, free water bottles at eating time...take them!., tickets $285.00 that leaves only $200 extra that is not bad. If your handicap in anyway , they do accommodate for you on everything! If you get motion sickness....do NOT do most of the rides here!., this park is fantastic on rides for roller coaster, neck jerking people!! The group would ride the rides for my daughter and I and tell us yes or no for us...like I say below, you make many new friends. So you might be thinking now, why did we do the tour if we don’t do rides. Well, we thought there would be more behind the scenes telling how the buildings were made or where they were brought in from etc. It was pretty much rides with our tour guide, not sure that all do the same thing. Even though with maybe 2 rides for us we enjoyed every else having a great time. It actually turns out to be more of a fun family- friends tour , as buy the end of the day you hate to say good- bye to all the great people that take the tour, 12 in group.. You eat together in a nice restaurant type area, just for VIP only. You talk and learn who why and how with them, lots of fun stories! I would do this again- hands down without even giving it a second thought. Disney is out of my price point. One family with a 14 years old boy said it’s the only way they do the parks now, which tells you they had money ( which I do not, this was a treat ) but we’re wonderful fun people that didn’t flaunt it."
733,2018-6,Kept us waiting over an hour at will call messed Heights are a lie... 51 should equal 51 we waited in line for an hour after going through one check point only to be denied 10 seconds before getting on after paying 240 for the day to skip the lines... I won’t return as this was a miserable experience
734,2018-6,"I am a travel agent and I accompanied a group to this park for a day. The park is medium in size and this allows you to stay even one day to save on the very high cost of the ticket. The attractions are a lot of fun and are for both adults and children compared to Disney parks made especially for children. However, I recommend visiting especially Universal Studios in Los Angeles (California) because it is a better park for the reason that it is located in Hollywood and is more in tune with the themes of the various films as there is a shuttle that takes you directly to the sets film"
735,2018-6,"I was with family without any children so for us, the wait times didn’t matter. However, if you have children of any age, BUY THE EXPRESS PASS. 30 and 45 minutes doesn’t seem too bad, but it adds up and definitely affects how much you can do in one day. Even if you have multiple days to spend at each park, sadly, because I hate giving in to these things, if children in tow, buy the passes."
736,2018-6,"I've written another review about Universal under the Harry Potter area but now one more specifically for Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure.  In general, this place is a feast for the senses. Aesthetically pleasing to the eye and lots of interesting things to do. Most of the 'rides' are cinematic simulators which are nice and clever but after a few of them you recognise the format and it starts to grind a little. My teenage son wanted to feel real gforce and found the attractions underwhelming. For the very few rides that there were in both parks, be warned that if you are of a 'non-normal' shape and size, you'll be unceremoniously kicked off the ride and made to wait at the exit. This happened to me three times because the slim seats fits but the safety bars wouldn't go down ""3 clicks"". Yes I get that this is a safety feature which is right and yes you can check beforehand on the seats and yes I could lose weight etc etc but actually this is irrelevant, why can't Universal use a better formula to be more inclusive of different shapes and sizes? Disney manage it fine, is Universal on a budget? A guy standing with me just had wide shoulders and wasn't even that large and he was upset that he got kicked off the Mummy returns. I can see why.  Anyway, by the third time this happened, I felt absolutely dreadful and started to cry at the exit of the Hatry Potter escape from Gringotts ride. A really lovely ride assistant toom pity on me and worked hard to try and cheer me up which was kind. She also offered to treat us to some gifts from the candy shop in Diagon Alley which she didn't have to do but as I mentioned in my other review, the thing that stood out for me was her gesture of making me feel valued and cared for, so thank you Nikki, you made a horrible humiliating situation much better!  I suspect the other two rides I didn't try, Hulk and RIP ride, would have been the same story.  I did have a good time at the Studios overall although I felt ripped off for the express passes and ride factor. Universal must have hundreds of thousands of people coming through their doors and I cannot believe they have built rides without different shapes and sizes in mind. I'm not even that large but looking some others who were large and managed to fit on, I can see that it's a bit of a lottery as to whether you'll fit. I'm not sure I'll want to come back again as it made me feel as though I didn't fit in. Something I thought Universal movies were meant to moralise over. You can do better Universal, much better."
737,2018-7,The express pass and flying with Harry Potter More than I’d hoped for as part of my bucket list. I’d go again in a heartbeat!
738,2018-7,"I was in Orlando for work and decided to go to Universal Studios Florida to see the Harry Potter (Diagon Alley). It took a good 45 minutes just to walk from the parking lot to the location and then there is only one ride in the Harry Potter area – one ride for the mob of people that are there visiting. It was just shops and overly priced food. I ate at the Leaky Cauldron and spent a fortune just for myself for a small dish of cottage pie that came with a salad. The line was so long just to get food. In the total part of this park, there are a small amount of total rides and the majority are inside where you sit in a seat that moves (Shrek and Minions). There was one big roller coaster and it was a long ride and tons of twists and turns and very fast. If you have neck issues, you should consider avoiding this ride or try to sit with your back as straight back against the seat as possible which is not easy to do with all the movement. There were lots of characters around the park, which would be fun for little kids. But I just think the amount of money they charge is so not worth it and the walking is outrageous. You go through an entire area of restaurants (City Walk) before even getting to the park. Be forewarned, if you are overweight, you may have a very difficult time getting on the Harry Potter ride – Escape from Gringotts – the seats are very small and the bar must come down all the way; they had to turn people away who were really not even that overweight – so shame on Universal for creating a ride without proper seating for all guests; they could easily remove two seats on each car to mark for a larger person. The security to get into any Universal area was quite long when I was there and everyone was bunched together in a central area and the lines started almost when you were at the location to be scanned – very poor planning. Would have no desire to ever return. I had been to the other park a few years ago and again would have no desire to go back."
739,2018-7,"Definitely worth it! Yes it's expensive but you wont experience anything like it anywhere else. It's great for adults, kids and couples. It's huge so a lot of walking, be prepared."
740,2018-7,"The Hagrid ride and Et ride was closed as they were broken and all the Harry Potter rides (which is why we went there), were very extreme roller coaster rides. If you have a bad neck or back or motion sickness, don't go on the Harry Potter rides! If you go there I highly recommend the valet parking. It gets you thru a shorter security line and puts you as close to the park as you can get. It is $40 more than the regular parking fee and worth every penny. We ordered our tickets online and printed them at the will call kiosk outside the park , which was easy and also saved you from long lines. We also purchased the express pass and it qas wirth every penny. For instance, the Gringotts ride was a 65 minute wait and we were in and out in 10 minutes!  I would not go to Universal or Islands of Adventure again. The Disney Parks offer more for your money."
741,2018-7,"After our cruise we spent some time at Universal Studios City Walk. Lots to do including put putt golf and Blue Man Group, both we did.This place is great for people of ALL ages."
742,2018-7,"We spent four days in Orlando and went to Universal on our second day. We loved it! We have two teenager boys who also really enjoyed it. Because it was Thanksgiving week, we purchased a fast pass. It was a great investment to be able to get on the rides quicker during the peak tourist season. The Christmas decorations were a fun touch too."
743,2018-7,We went to Rock the Universe to see the best Christian musicians. Great family fun at Universal Studios.
744,2018-7,While it was pretty expensive for two parks in one day for the three of us we still had a great time.
745,2018-7,"The only reason I bothered with Universal was because my husband REALLY wanted to see Harry Potter World. And I do have to give them kudos--HP was done really well! The rides are great and the scenery is fantastic. But in order to see both sections of the Wizarding World, you had to pay for admission into BOTH parks, which was an outright ripoff. As for the rest of the park, hoo-boy. Sad, sad, SAD doesn't even cover it. Nickelodeon Studios is long since gone, having been replaced by the Blue Man Group. Just....UGH. I had the ""pleasure"" of seeing this show back in 2010 and was bored after what seemed like the first ninety-bajillion minutes of similar tricks and antics. As for the remainder of the park, well....it desperately needs a MAJOR overhaul. The majority of the attractions are no longer relevant. Seriously, The Simpsons is far from popular anymore. Dr. Seuss World is mediocre at best. Although I love the E.T. ride, I wanted to cry--Hubby and I found ourselves getting onto said ride without any wait and buying a souvenir in the abandoned gift shop next to the equally cobweb-laden SpongeBob Storepants. Feivel's Playland on the opposite side was a ghost town (I actually saw tumbleweeds). (Honestly, is there a soul younger than 30 years of age who even KNOWS who Feivel is anymore?) Please, PLEASE, Universal. Be wise. Refurbish. (I do have to say that the one--and only--thing Universal did better than Disney was City Walk. That area is a great idea and wisely located, especially since the parks close so friggin' early and people still want to hang out and have dinner and such.)"
746,2018-7,"We were trying to figure out whether to but two days at Universal or one day. We choose the 1 day - 2 park with express pass. This saved us a day in the park as we were able to see and ride all we wanted easily in a single day. We considered 2 day - 2 park with 1 day express pass so our savings in the park was one day food, parking and about $120 per ticket."
747,2018-7,"It seemed like every ""adventure"" was just another simulator with a different theme. I was really, really disappointed . Seemed like the excitement that I remember from several years ago has gone.  On the positive side, the lines were very reasonable on the day of our visit."
748,2018-7,"This was a nice park with fairly good rides, but the experience was somewhat ruined by the ""express pass"" concept. This was incredibly unfair, and Disney handles this so much better. What they don't tell you is that your tickets do not guarantee you get to ride their rides, they just get you into the park. At that point you essentially have standby tickets. If there is nobody in the express line, they will let some of the regular people (90% of the park population at least) onto the ride. It's maddening to watch these people cut in front of us again and again, and they make no effort to hide the express lines from view. They just walk right by the normals over and over again, while we wait hours for a major attraction. If you don't pay for the express tickets, you are limited to either the lesser rides in the park (and still waiting 15-60 minutes), or to waiting as much as 4 hours to go on a major ride. Yes, I saw them at 240 minutes. Meanwhile, the express passers can walk right onto any ride. If you don't pay the extra for the express pass, you've basically been fooled into buying standby access."
749,2018-7,"So fun!!! This is my second time coming here and let me tell you about it! Their are a lot of things to do, Simpson’s land, Etc. it’s really big and fun for the whole family!"
750,2018-7,"Two parks of pure family fun, something for everyone without the Hassle of enormous crowds and extreme overpricing !!!! We went during Christmas and yes it was very busy but still acceptable and yes some things are pricey but not every thing !!!! All ages can enjoy both parks. City Walk does have Expensive Restaurants but there are average eateries as well and you can shop and mini-golf too !! Guest Relations and Employee's are ""AWESOME"", they will work out any problem that may arise !!"
751,2018-7,"My boyfriend & I have been passholders for years now and we love this park so much! They have great rides, good food, tons to do in City Walk, and there are some cool perks being passholders as well."
752,2018-7,"If you can, go early. Place fills up quickly. Harry Potter was done beautifully, and it feels like a page out of the movies. We got the park hopper to be able to ride the Hogwarts Express. That entire experience was phenomenal. Definitely get the express pass. The lines are worth it! The only reason it doesn't get more stars is because compared to Disney where friendliness and service is notable, you can tell here that such things are not that high on their list. They're just looking to quickly move the masses from one thing to the next. And the table cleanliness is a joke. Be prepared to clean every area you plan to sit and eat on."
753,2018-7,Universal in Orlando is a great time!! Parking is efficient. I had trouble finding the uber station. Package pick up was great and easy to use highly recommended instead of carrying all your stuff.
754,2018-7,"My wife and I have been to Disney MULTIPLE times so we thought that we'd try out Universal Studios without our kids. In our opinion, this should not even be called an ""Amusement"" park. The value of entertainment that you receive for the high price of admission and parking is very low compared to other options such as all of the Disney parks or even a place like FunSpot. Universal only has 1 true roller coaster, which was closed on the day that we went due to high winds, and every other ride is some sort of Virtual Reality experience. For my money I'd rather go to Cedar Point in Ohio and ride 10+ roller coasters all day than spend $120+ on a ticket here."
755,2018-7,Great place for the family! One day is not enough time for all the fun things to do! An absolute must!
756,2018-7,"We spent one day at Universal with a ticket good for both parks in order to see all of the Harry Potter attractions. First, you will need to buy a ticket for both parks to see both Harry Potter London and Harry Potter Hogwarts. I will say that both areas are nicely done, especially Diagon Alley.  Expecting long waits for the Hogwarts Adventure we arrive around 8 am for a 9 am opening and were among the first 50 people to enter the park. We made a beeline for the ride only to be told there was an hour or more delay. We decided that this would still likely be the shortest wait of the day we stayed in line for 2 and 1/2 hours before giving up. The ride did not not start until 4 pm in the afternoon. We later learned that the ride had been down the day before. Why would they keep you hanging on if they knew there were serious problems?  Having lost two hours of time, we had to prioritize the rest of the day. Rides are a mixed bag. Skull Island was a lot of fun. The Mummy and Poseidon's Adventure are dated. Jurassic Park was closed.  Despite being at the park in late January when crowds are fairly low, lines for the main attractions were at least 30 - 50 minutes.  The Universal version of a fast pass is an additional $79 and omits the Hogwarts ride! Did not seem to be worth it.  If you want to ride 5 or 6 of the main attractions you will spend 4 - 6 hours in line. It is a tough slog to have fun."
757,2018-7,"Was not impressed with Universal theme park. Not enough rides as Jurassic Park was blocked off. We had no warning that a big part of the park was closed. Gift shops were all open as were food and drink stands. 1 day ticket for 1 person cost $195.00, same $ for each theme park. We have been in all of the other parks and LOVED everyone of them. We now wish we had repeated another park. Universal was sorry!"
758,2018-8,"This was our first trip to Universal. We have always done Disney and love Disney, but wanted something different and also are obsessed with Harry Potter. We were absolutely blown away by Universal. From the parking to the dining and shopping. Everything exceeded our expectations and then some. For the money, we enjoyed Universal as much as if not more than Disney. The theming was immaculate, the park was clean and easy to get around. If you like Harry Potter then you absolutely have to visit the Wizarding World at USF and IOA. It was incredible. We can't wait to go back!"
759,2018-8,"Even with the park without many people, most of the attractions with 5 to 10 minutes of line, the unfair policy of Express to skip lines takes place. Even in Attractions 5-10 min line, with 2 or 5 people in the line, we are put on hold to 30 to 60 people in the Express line pass you. The most cool and newest attractions 1 to 2 hours of line. Every 2 to 3 persons in the regular line goes through, 30 to 60 goes trough the Express line, totally unfair, taking out the joy of being there with regular tickets, and it is blowing mind to pay twice to enjoy the park even with a few people in the parks, is totally unfair to do that. That way me and my family didn’t enjoy many attractions at all."
760,2018-8,Great mix of attractions for my 10 and 13 yr old boys. Better than Islands of Adventure. Ride cues are well covered (good for hot and cold days). Clean park. Fun shows.
761,2018-8,So many shops and fun rides. Good time to go before the heat and spring break crowd was not bad. Still like California better tho it’s cool to have been to both.
762,2018-8,The attractions make this park worth the visit - especially if you have Harry Potter Fans. We booked the Wizarding World vacation package and liked the perks that came along with it.  Be ready to wait on line - as the good rides do not all take the Express Passes. Be ready to wait on line for food. Be ready to wait to on line for everything. Not sure why but no ice cream location other than in the Harry Potter section was open. The guest experience left a lot to be desired if you expect a Disney type experience with readily available guest services and good eating - you will be disappointed.
763,2018-8,"During our Orlando vacation we decided to spend the day at Universal. We bought the one-day, 2 park pass which allowed us to go to Universal Studios and Universal's Islands of Adventure. It is totally doable to go to both parks in one day as long as you start early and finish the day late.  We totally recommend spending the extra to get the Express Pass. Most of the rides had about a 30-45 minute wait time while we were there and the Express Pass usually resulted in a 5-10 minute wait instead. This allowed us to enjoy the park and not spend half the day in line ups. We did make the mistake of getting the unlimited Express Pass. The regular Express Pass allows you to go on each ride once which was enough for us. However, for those wanting to go on the same ride more than once it doesn't really cost that much more for the unlimited Express Pass.  While the tickets are very pricey, we agreed that the cost was well worth it. If there are any Harry Potter fans in your group they will feel like they've gone to Potter Heaven. The rides and sites for HP are out of this world."
764,2018-8,Fork out the extra money for the express pass. Much shorter lines. Worth the cost. And then just know you will have to wait in lines even with the pass. Just chill out and enjoy. Every time we were in line we met some nice people. The Hobbit is a must see and easy to miss if you’re not watching out for it.
765,2018-8,"Universal Studios is fantastic by far the best selection of rides! Brilliant child swap service, unlike Disney which has a non existent child swap service! And all round a fantastic day! Highly recommend especially with children that can not ride!"
766,2018-8,"Our Universal Studio experience was ok until my daughter and her best friend got their iPhones stolen from a 'secured ' locker. My daughter was required to store her purse and their iPhones at locker was NOT secured as her purse was stolen along with their iPhones. The locker was empty when she used her ticket to open it. If the riders are REQUIRED to store their valuables before they can ride, then there should be more attendants present to monitor the lockers. I called back that evening as instructed to see if any purse were turn in, only to get a message about filling out the form online. I find the requirement to store items without monitoring is unacceptable. Also lost my refillable cup while I was helping my young daughter catching beads at the parade. A lot of dishonest people there! Will leave update after I hear back from Universal Studio."
767,2018-8,"Indoor rides are really seeing the videos at each turn , swoop or stop of the car you ride in- not for preschoolers, in my opinion. Wait till kids are 8 years old and up! Expensive and worth it!!"
768,2018-8,"After two days of disappointment at Disney we really enjoyed universal, smaller lines less crowding not such a cash grab for everything."
769,2018-8,"Our son loved it. Our pockets hated it :) Yes, its like in the movies, yes you feel the magic. However, for me, an adult joyning my son and not interested to get into any of the carousels or other experiences, I felt extremly frustrated that I had to pay 170 USD just for being a pedestrian in this park. I think there should be lower price for the accompanying adult who is not interested in the experience as such. I spent anyway money on food, merchandise etc. "
770,2018-8,"My husband and I went here for our 10th anniversary and had the absolute best day! Crowd was low and we were able to go on every single ride and we watched all of the shows. We even went to the NBC Media Center and watched and rated a tv show and earned a gift card. We used that pay for lunch, so that was a nice bonus. This has definitely become our favorite theme park."
771,2018-8,"First time to Universal parks. Went particularly for the Harry Potter experience - Diagon Alley. Every section of the park felt like we were walking onto a movie set. Had lunch at the Leaky Cauldron. Love that all of the staff members stay in character so that you get the true experience. Well done, Universal!"
772,2018-8,Universal receives A++++ in regards to their customer service. My son has a seizure disorder and the Park was amazing handling his needs. He received a card with return times for lines greater than 30 minutes. If line was less than 30 minutes he was able to get right on; and they gave us multiple return times at the same time so we could do an area of the park and move on to the next when done.  Hats off to you Universal for making my son feel like a King for two days. He finally felt like he was “special” and not “different” I wish I could say the same for Disney.... where we could only reserve one “fast pass” with the DAS at a time. We spent most of our day sitting around doing nothing.
773,2018-8,"Universal Studios was pretty quiet our first morning and found it not well suited for toddlers for a full day. Too many rides in a shaking box but my family made the most of both parks. As we traveled a long distance, the Express Pass was worth it."
774,2018-8,"Third time to Universal and as always, we had a great time and so much fun. We went in February and it wasn’t too hot to walk through the park."
775,2018-8,"Visited in February 2020. We purchased the two park ticket for Universal Studios and Islands of adventure. It was not a particularly busy day but still a lot of people and lines. The thrill rides are great and you can save a bit of time using the single rider lines when they are available. Most rides that we used single rider we ended up being on the same car just different rows. We got to go on all the rides and see all the attractions we wanted to except for the Harry Potter ride which had 3-4 hour wait times and some points during the day broke down.  My issue with the park is the outrageously expensive prices for any food/drink, and the attitude of a lot of the staff. The staff particularly those working at food kiosks are all very monotone and disinterested and make ordering a drink a bit of an ordeal.  Overall we had a good time but felt as if we had paid too much for the experience and had been coaxed out of as much money as possible.  If you’re a family paying a lot of money to visit, plan your day very carefully to try and get the best value from your ticket.  Tip: leave the Popeye ride for last otherwise you will spend the day wet with soggy shoes"
776,2018-8,"The best part of Universal was walking through Wizarding World of Harry Potter & I still think there were missed opportunities. Rides really weren't that impressive. Actually kind of disappointed that I spent the time & $. Hate that every time you want to ride you have to pay more $ to put your stuff in lockers (free ones, when you could find any, weren't high enough to put a small backpack in). Really? Lockers? Never returning."
777,2018-8,"Stayed at the Hard Rock so got Express passes which were well worth it. Seemed busy but never had to queue more than about 25 mins for a ride. Was with kids aged 6 (who’s 45 inches so couldn’t go on any rides over 48 inches much to his annoyance) and 9.  Some absolute highlights and our 6 year old could go on most things. Spider-Man, Jimmy Fallon, Gringotts, Minions, Transformers, Hippogriff, huge red rollercoaster, Revenge of the Mummy all outstanding. Park was clean, service was good. Really, really enjoyable."
778,2018-8,Had a great time here so much to do loads of rides. Even came back in the evening to city walk there’s no parking fees after 6pm. And you can even go into universal until 9pm. City walk have some fab restaurants and some of them have groups singing definately will come back again.
779,2018-9,After visiting for many years and seeing most of the venues I spend a lot of my time with my family at CITYWALK. We love the Bob Marley restaurant with a great menu and music.
780,2018-9,"Loved visiting Springfield, diagon alley, New York, and got absolutely fired up on the rip ride rock it. Could easily spend a week there exploring and seeing new things."
781,2018-9,"This was a fun day .... definitely pay the extra for express pass!!!!!! Only attraction that is unorganised and a complete waste of time (we walked out half way through) is The tonight show with Jimmy Fallon. You wait downstairs, then when you eventually get sent up stair case you enter a hall filled with hundreds of other people sitting around & you don’t know where you are meant to go or what you are meant to be doing ..... nor HOW LONG YOU NEED TO WAIT HERE. .... they started calling various coloured tickets to enter the next show area .... but ours was 4(!!!!!) colours away from being called .... there was no one around telling people what to do or what to expect so we just found nearest exit and left - complete waste of time! Best attraction by far is the Harry Potter section - we’ve never read the books nor seen the movies but we were hooked. It’s truly incredible! (We said we would read the books now)."
782,2018-9,"I last visited 6 years ago so it was very different for me, my fiance hasn't been since he was 10 so it was majorly different for him. The Harry Potter updates are excellent - Gringots was one of our fave rides. Simpsons is a must do for me, its one of my faves. This year we did both the Animal actors show which was cute and also the Horror Makeup Show which was excellent. I will make sure to pay a visit to both when we return! We where there whilst Halloween Horror Nights and we visited 2 nights. Both nights where excellent, we loved the 80's heavy theming through out the houses and scare zones. Stranger Things being a particular favourite of ours. The show on the lake was amazing. Nice surprise for us - The Jimmy Fallon ride after reading not so good reviews we loved it!! Can't wait to visit again soon!!!"
783,2018-9,We had park to park passes and had a great time. No need for express passes because the wait times are reasonable. The characters are walking around and interact with you. We got through Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure in two days and were able to ride almost every ride and interact with multiple character. We wished we had booked more time here and less time at Disney.
784,2018-9,"This was much better than Disney. I'll never go back to Disney but I would go back the Universal. The characters are walking around and interact with you. The wait times for rides are reasonable. We were able to get through both parks, interact with multiple characters and ride almost every ride in two days."
785,2018-9,"We last visited about 5 years ago, so there have been many additions to both parks since our last visit. We love the new additions for Harry Potter. We enjoyed Diagon alley and Escape from Gringotts, the train ride connecting the 2 parks and our favorite was Hagrid's motorbike ride. We love that there are also food chains within the park so you don't have to eat the same old park fare. We had pretzels at Aunt Annies and a turkey leg at Thunder Falls. We enjoyed riding some old favorites, like Men in Black, The Mummy, Rip Rockit, and The Hulk. Be sure to get a fast pass by either staying at a resort hotel, or purchasing since it allows you to get on many more rides and avoid the long lines."
786,2018-9,"Universal studios was lots of fun on our girls adventure trip. We were in Orlando for 3 nights and visited Disney on day 2 and universal on day 3. We covered a lot of ground ( 11 miles in Disney) but we’re able to see/ experience many things we’d hoped to see. Universal studios was full of fun rides, great photo ops and adventure.  Parking was much easier at universal vs Disney. They offer a parking garage and lots of moving sidewalks making it much more accessible vs the buses/ teams etc that Disney has."
787,2018-9,"Universal Mardi Gras parade is a must see. Floats,dancers and beads everywhere. I was lucky enough to get a reservation on a float to throw beads. When in the park check out the Universal park App for Mardi Gras parade . Two hours before they will open up times to be on a float. But be quick because they close out fast!!"
788,2018-9,"I really enjoyed the time we spent, the coolest rollercoaster is the ¨Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit¨ and The Harry Potter World was fantastic the food was greta and the client attention was good."
789,2018-9,"Universal studios is the place to go! Spent several days at Disney (unfortunately) and were very disappointed and felt cheated. Universal was wonderful! No ridiculous lines, lots of fun rides intermingled for all ages. Good restaurants with nice variety and fair prices. Can’t say a bad thing about. Employees were friendly, helpful and playful."
790,2018-9,"We had heard good things about the VIP Experience Tour and decided to go for it since none of us have patience for long lines. While there are a few things that could be improved, the whole experience was phenomenal and I would never recommend anything but the VIP Experience.  We arrived at around 9:00 am on a Friday for a 9:30 two-park tour. We had not had any communication from the park, so it was a bit confusing and we had to ask around to figure out where to go for check-in. Once we checked in, we were given badges and walking directions to La Bamba, the VIP Experience restaurant. With security, check-in, and walking to the breakfast buffet at La Bamba, we only had about 5 minutes to eat, so I'd recommend giving yourself a little more time. The breakfast buffet was underwhelming with styrofoam plates, a plastic tablecloth, and a meager selection. That being said, it was nice to have a few minutes to grab some eggs and bacon. Our group was two other families for a total of 9 people. All were very go-with-the-flow, so it was a great group.  Once we got going, we hit 12 rides over both parks from 9:30-4:00 pm. My daughter was unable to ride the taller rides, so we skipped the Hulk, which was the last ride for our group. The experience was great, and there was virtually no waiting at all, with very limited exceptions. We typically entered the rides through the exit or back-lot and walked right onto the rides, skipping the lines entirely. Our tour guide was phenomenal and very accommodating, particularly with our 6yo, and made sure everyone had a great time. Overall, it is less of an informational tour and more about getting a curated experience with zero lines.  Pros - We were able to ride 12 rides in one day, including all of the “greatest hits” (Hagrid’s Motorbike Adventure, Forbidden Journey, Escape from Gringott's) - True VIP experience: our guide made sure that we hit everything we wanted and more. He steered us away from the bad rides and even allowed our daughter to ride the Hippogriff coaster twice, when she couldn’t join the rest of the group on the big rides. - Great service – our guide had my daughters wand fixed/replaced at Ollivander’s twice due to issues. - Breakfast and lunch, along with bottled waters - No crowds to contend with and no lines whatsoever - Get to see some behind-the-scenes areas of the rides - Our tour guide was very responsive and made sure everyone was able to do what they wanted - The cost was only about $100 more/person than an express pass and worth much more - VIP pass turns into an express pass after the tour and gives you discounts on merchandise everywhere in the park - Ponchos for everyone on the Jurassic Park ride, which was helpful given the cooler temps that day  Cons - The communication beforehand was not great. There was not clear direction about where to go for the VIP Experience, even in the App. It would be nice to have some level of guidance. - La Bamba - The breakfast food at La Bamba was not great and the Styrofoam plates were not a good touch. The restaurant was very dated and the décor feels sad and tacky. The service was pretty lacking as well. - We did not spend enough time at Diagon Alley, which was what our group wanted to do. I understand that tour was about rides but it would have been fun to have a little more time to explore. We did get to go back afterwards and explore on our own. - There is some part of the experience that you miss by not going through the lines. For example, we didn’t get to see any of the inside of the castle - The experience has ruined us from ever doing anything but the VIP Experience in the future"
791,2018-9,Fast passes are a must to enjoy the rides and we’ll worth the extra cost. Ages 6-adult enjoyed moving quickly through the lines. A Fav park for us
792,2018-9,"First of all we had a good time but it was just my husband and I not an entire family! Parking is $26 and the ticket price varies but is a lot of money for most people. We had a one day pass and not the 2 park 1 day pass. We did Universal Studios and enjoyed the rides, especially Hogwarts and Jimmy Fallon. Luckily it was a quiet day and the lines not very long. We could have gone on rides multiple times if we wanted and if we had purchased the two park pass, had plenty of time to see the other park. I'm not sure how families afford the high food and drink prices along with the expensive tickets. We had a good time - but once was enough since there wasn't all that much that would bring us back to that park."
793,2018-9,"Arrived early, it was cool, and no crowds. Parking too expensive and did not eat. Jurassic Park good, Hulk roller coaster was wonderful. Poseidon's Fury terrible."
794,2018-9,"The park execs need to go over to Disney and figure out the benefits of having a much better app, queuing system and electronic wristbands. I feel like the park hasn’t updated itself in 15 years. The odd staff are outstanding, especially the performers and the characters. But overall a poor experience which is a shame because the rides are more fun than Disney but the overall experience is “needs to be better.”"
795,2018-9,"Looking forward to going back. Everything was very good. Good rides, great interaction with Marvel characters. Nice change of pace from Disney"
796,2018-9,"2 years ago we visited all 4 Disney parks. This year we tried Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure (me, my husband and 10 year old son). Universal was amazing! There's something for everyone - big coasters and tons of 3D and 4D rides and experiences. The Harry Potter experience was stunning and far exceeded our expectations. We went on a Wednesday, 85 degrees and sunny, and they longest wait was 25 minutes. If you're willing use the Single Rider line, it was 3-4 minutes. We rode most rides 2 or 3 times. We did not buy express passes as there were small crowds. If you haven't tried Universal yet, I highly recommend it!"
797,2018-9,"Completely overrated and overpriced! Their staff is rude, clueless and urgently needs training!! I don’t mind paying for quality but paying $13 for a slice of pizza or $25 for inedible pasta is ridiculous. The worst part is the attitude of their employees. It’s like they don’t want to be there! My DD has food allergies, which was a non issue at WDW, but At Universal they made us feel like we were being difficult. The staff was not only clueless as to what ingredients were in the food but they were rude about it. One lady took forever to go get a manual, flip through pages to finally say well the burger you want is not on here. Another gentleman refused to serve us two scoops of ice cream - mind you the price was for 2 scoops- because he said it was going to fall off because the flavor we wanted was too soft and the cups were too small. How ridiculous is that! The $18 margarita we ordered tasted like bitter lemonade. For that price you’d think it would have some alcohol in it. So many examples of awful service but the worst was that we got a virtual ticket for jimmy Fallon ride for 8:10pm which is 10 minutes after the park closes. (See pic attached) You cannot wait in line for this ride. You need a virtual pass. However their system gave us a time that didn’t exist basically. So we couldn’t go on the ride at all!!! When we went to guest services to complain, instead of giving us a fast pass for another day, the lady just said it’s a technical issue, nothing we can do about it. You could tell she did not want to be there at all. I wish we would’ve stayed at WDW!! Horrible customer service at Universal!!!"
798,2018-9,This is a great place for older children and adults. The rides are great and the parks are very clean and well taken care of.
799,2018-10,"Our group of 10 enjoyed all the Universal Studios rides. Their favorites were Despicable Me, Fat and Furious, Escape from Gringotts, Hogwarts Express, !!!Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit, Men in Black, Race Through New York, Revenge of Mummy, and Transformers. We stayed at an AMAZING hotel, Hard Rock Universal, which gave us the privilege of front of the line access to rides, which is great for our group of 10. Hard Rock Universal is within walking distances which is absolutely wonderful, especially since the weather was beautiful. All in all we had a wonderful trip to Universal."
800,2018-10,"Wow, has it changed! Mostly for the better...  Shame that Back to the Future has been changed to the Simpsons ride.  MIB was good fun, and we got to visit the immigration room!  Last time I was here I was 15. This visit was for my 40th, and I was trying to picture the park in my head as it was, as I was walking around. Would have like to have seen somewhere that showed the park over the years, pictures & maps etc. Mels, with the cars outside, was a welcome sight. I remember the Jurrassic Park vehicles being near it in '95. (I still have a JP tamagotchi I bought at the time!)  So much to do, and something different for everyone.  The food in some places is very questionable, and not worth the money. Simpsons land (Krusty Burger) is one example of don't bother. Pizza slice from one of the vendors however, delightful, plentyful and worth the money.  Stayed for one of the Mardigras nights, and had a great time. Floats were great, dancers; Spectacular.  If you haven't been in a few years like me, then now is the time to go!  Last note: Get the fast pass, we were on rides within 20 mins for most parts, rode most twice within 30!"
801,2018-10,"We spent four days visiting Universal Studios, Orlando and enjoyed every minute of our experience. By staying on property at Cabana Bay, we were able to maximize our experience, by being able to access the parks earlier than the general public. I have been a Disney fanatic, since 1972, but will no longer visit this them park, because of overcrowding and because Universal is a better theme park. It is constantly updating its attractions, so the park NEVER gets boring and although it has large crowds, we were able to get on EVERY ride we wanted to, unlike Disney. The water park, Volcano Bay is one of the best water parks, we have ever been to with lots of greenery to provide cooling shade and a great mixture of water activities for people of all ages. We have been Universal Studios on 5 different years and have never grown bored or tired of going back."
802,2018-10,"I visited last summer with my 12 year old son and we had a fantastic few days in this park. We managed to get in early, even though we weren't Universal hotel residents and got on three rides before 9am which was a bonus! The Minions ride is hilarious, as is the Simpsons ride. My son loved Transformers and we got to meet Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and Megatron at different times during our visit. When you come out of the shop, look to a shutter door to your right and that's where you'll find them. Harry Potter is FANTASTIC! Loved the way you walk through the wall to get there. We loved that experience and Escape from Gringotts was fantastic. Given that we were there during peak times, the queue times were really good and we got on lots of rides. Such a fun place to be, love it there."
803,2018-10,"1st visit, great time. Quick lines, awesome rides. Good family fun. Will definitely come back to visit."
804,2018-10,This is the Best Theme Park that I ever go. It make the unforgettable experience for me in a good way. It's better than Disney World where I hope it's good as I expect when I was a kid after went to Disney land Paris but it turned out in another way.
805,2018-10,An experience I ill never forget of both fun and wonder! Certainly one of the best parks in the world in one of funniest city ever!
806,2018-10,"We haven't been to this area in years, but Universal Studios was a highlight of our trip. We didn't buy the speed pass, but we didn't need it on the day we went. The waits were short, and the rides were all thrilling, (and we don't like rides!). We had a blast."
807,2018-10,"After the walking and stair climbing we did in one day, we felt like we completed the Universe! Would not have changed it for a thing. Universal definitely has the whole fast pass thing over Disney. Yes it is expensive, but only having one day to do it all we did 17 rides in 8 hours. This was worth every penny. Highly recommend going to Universal and spend the money if you don't have the time."
808,2018-10,"Good stay. Manageable in a day. But we accidentally went into Island of Adventure by mistake because the parks are right next to each other. The signage could have been better because we were very lost. It was our first time. But overall, we enjoyed ourselves and the Expresses passes are highly recommended!"
809,2018-10,We went to the park on a Tuesday on the first week of Feb. It was very nice to go on a day that wasn't packed and all the rides at the park were pretty easy to get on without a long wait. The longest wait was the Harry Potter ride and that was only 30 minutes. All the rides a great and updated and I am happy to see that compared to disney.
810,2018-10,"I went back to Universal Studios after 24 years and it brought me back to being a kid again. All the old attractions from then are gone (with the exception of E.T.) but it didn't matter as the new rides are exciting and a thrill to ride. My favorite was probably the Rip, Ride, Rocket roller coaster with The Incredible Hulk at Islands of Adventure being a close second. I would also highly recommend in investing in an annual preferred pass if you are planning on going to the parks more than twice a year. Additionally, it will save you money on such things as parking, concession stand discounts, and most importantly, allow you to ride the Hogwarts express from Park-to-Park! I will certainly be going back and making use of my annual pass to enjoy some of the things I might have missed on this weekend trip."
811,2018-10,"I've wanted to go to Universal Studio Florida for years. It's been a long, long time since we visited Universal in California and I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. We got the two park, three day resident ticket and stayed at a nearby hotel off the property. Getting to the hotel and the park was a hassle because of the construction. Universal had nothing to do with this.  Parking was quick and easy with guides to show me the way. The $26 fee was a bit steep - not unreasonable. The walk to the gates was reasonable, especially with the moving sidewalks. Buying the annual passes was a bit confusing. It was hard to tell where one was supposed to be.  Then, we got into the park.  Let me start out by saying that Universal is not Disney. Disney is organized by different Lands, like Epcot, Frontierland, and so on. Universal is more organized by different movies or shows. There were two sections dedicated to Harry Potter, the Simpsons, Jurassic Park, etc. Different and not bad. Disney sometimes is too flawless. Universal is a bit grittier. It's not as clean and completely acceptable.  The rides at Universal were, in general, awesome. I'm 69 years old. One of my traveling companions tricked me (by asking me) into riding a couple of the most intense coaster rides I've ever been on. I should have seriously reconsidered the ride when the ride required that prosthetic limbs be removed because they might fly off during the ride OMG. The Incredible Hulk Experience was like I never had before. Except for the Hollywood Red Ride which was almost as intense.  The train to Hogswart was a bit overdone. Hogsmeade in general was crowded - it was Harry Potter. We were unwilling to pay for Express or wait for an hour or so to ride the more popular rides. Almost everything else was simply wonderful.  We exited through Comic Strip village in Islands of Adventure. Very campy.  The next day we explored a bit more and rode the rides that told more of a story. Our first stop was Diagon Alley. It was exactly as I remember it from the movies. The wand shops were great, Gringotts was almost unbelievable. I bought a proof set of Gringotts coins. I expected to see a Quidich game overhead. The escape from Gringotts was, again, as I remember from the movie. I really felt a part of the movie.  Finally, they had a Mardi Gras parade in the French Quarter. I was amazed by the dancers, some of whom were on stilts that looked about 4 feet tall. And they danced. Awesome. We caught so many beads and the floats were well done.  The only hit on the entire day was being charged $5 for a half liter of water. That stung.  I highly recommend Universal Studio Florida. I'll wait until the Stunt show opens later this year."
812,2018-10,Was here 15 years ago! Was looking forward to a fun time going on all the rides! Started with the Woody Woodpecker rollercoaster! Would suggest that they bring back the Back to the Future Ride . .instead of Simpsons! Very relaxed fun time.
813,2018-10,It was very crowded right after Christmas. There was a five hour wait for Hagrids ride. But everywhere we went the employees all seemed to be doing their best to make sure our visit went as smoothly as possible even among the huge crowds. Kudos to Universal!
814,2018-10,"The universal park is perplexing in that a huge part of it consists of a simulated New York City and San Francisco. Not much to do there. As a fan of Harry Potter I would have preferred an expanded and more in-depth Diagon and Knockturn Alley. Walking in to it the first time is glorious. However the more time spent there the more you realize how limited it is. Gringotts is the most elaborate aspect with a wonderful ride. Highly recommend. Many of the stores however are just storefronts. The dragon over Gringotts is cool when it breathes fire (not working on the second day). The train to Islands of Adventure is awesome. (Also was not working on second day -“routine maintenance “. ). So here’s my question... if the Wizarding World is the biggest draw by far, why isn’t it bigger? Early entrance consisted of almost all guests walking through the Universal Studios park, heading directly to Diagon Alley (long walk from the gates) past the simulated New York etc. In Wizarding World be prepared to spend tons of money. Programmed Wands are $40 and up. I saw many kids waving these wands at various programmed things (fountains, windows) that were difficult to activate. A few employees (not enough of them) showing kids how to wave wands correctly for the 10 second response. Try the ice cream parlor for butter beer ice cream and other eccentric flavors like chocolate chili. Leaky Cauldron is a must. Do the Gringotts ride first and hit the wand store ( both have very long lines as the day goes on). Also the train line gets very long. Ride the train back and forth in the morning to avoid the hour long line later. Outside of Diagon Alley the rides are old and outdated. Suess World is cool for really young kids. ET, Men in Black, the big Greek temple are tedious compared to the Gringotts ride. I hope the park makes improvements and adds more to Wizarding World Diagon Alley. It would be cool if there was a wizards show on the stage there with special effects, a spell battle etc instead of a weird, campy singer with three back up singers. Knockturn Alley has great ambiance (dark and spooky with a dark arts store) but is way too small. This entire area should be expanded with more elaborate elements. Given the hyper inflated prices in the Diagon Alley stores I think they could afford this. We went in January primarily to avoid the massive crowds in high attendance times and for cooler weather. 70 degrees F was perfect but was still crowded. I cannot imagine being there during high attendance times. The waste of time standing in lines would not be worth the expense. Here’s another question...universal park was only open from 8 AM to 7 PM in January. So at this expensive highly popular park, why couldn’t They have done maintenance on the train and the dragon during the many hours the park is closed overnight instead of during the day? On to Islands of Adventure where you will find Hogsmeade. Stunning visual of Hogwarts castle and the greatest ride ever invented (forbidden journey). Flying through the air around Hogwarts is amazing. I want this ride at my house. The flying parts of this ride are epic but the intermittent parts that go inside Hogwarts are weird- more rudimentary. The town of Hogsmeade is cool. The roof tops and buildings are a masterpiece. Three broomsticks is a must of course. Pretty good food and excellent decor. However just like Diagon Alley in the other park, the more time you spend there the smaller it becomes. Again many storefronts (not actual experiences) and the stores have exorbitant prices. It was congested in the streets and stores. Again I cannot imagine being there during high attendance times and in the summer heat. And again there’s a weird show on the small stage with actors who look like they’re about to succumb to heat exhaustion. How about a quidditch demonstration instead or another wand battle or potions class etc? The rest of Islands of Adventure is huge (long walks). And of course Hogsmeade is in the back of the park (like Diagon Alley in the other park) so if the train is not an option you will have to walk through the entirety of both parks to visit both Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade ( which is a brilliant profit-making manipulation - must buy multiple park pass etc). Walking to the exit of Islands park takes about 20 minutes without small children or stopping along the way. The cartoon land in Islands is a surreal version of he’ll especially in the heat. Very loud repetitive music, weird old vintage stuff. Only attractions are a nausea inducing roller coaster and spider man rides. God help you if you have to walk through both parks to get to Wizarding world. If you plan your day in advance and hit the busiest parts of Wizarding world it is more enjoyable. Also more than one day is better."
815,2018-10,"This was a new ride introduced late December 2019, the wait was 90 minutes but well worth it. This is a 2 person ride, one on the motorbike and another in the sidecar. There are no loops in this rider, however does not detract from the thrill of this ride. It is fast and entertaining and you will want to have another turn! Highly recommended for all. Please note there is a height limit."
816,2018-10,We had a fabulous time at Universal Studios. But our favourite was the Harry Potter section.. From wands and magic to trains and moterbikes... this is an awesome way to spend a day (or more if you have the time!)
817,2018-10,"We are annual pass holders at Universal in Los Angeles and love going there but the park in Orlando is even better. The quality of rides, food options and staff are much better in Florida. Well with the trip to sunny Florida and spend your time here for a few days."
818,2018-10,"Had a great time here. Spent 3 days at the park and made the most of express tickets. It's a world of it's own, with fun rides, food carts, shops, restaurants and just an amazing happy atmosphere. We visited in January so not a very busy time, as local kids were at school. Wednesday and Thursday were the best days but got busier on Friday. We were able to do many rides twice, sometimes three times. Did not get a chance to do Volcano Bay but there was already so much to do at Universal and Islands of Adventure. Loved Citywalk for its great restaurants and so many food options. Even managed to get halal food (our dietary requirement) at some restaurants. Some of the favourite rides were Men In Black, Escape from Gringotts, Spiderman, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, Skull Island, Revenge of the Mummy, Simpsons, Transformers and many more. Even braved the very fast Hagrid's Motorbike Adventure ride!"
819,2018-11,"We had a limited amount of time to go visit so we focused on a 2 park ticket for Harry Potter. Loved it! We opted not to get the express pass as it would’ve cost us an extra $700. We got to the parks shortly after they opened and our wait time for the rides we wanted was minimal. The only thing we didn’t have time to do was look at the castle for the Forbidden Journey ride. But again we just wanted to view the castle not ride the ride this go around since our girls were only 8 & 9. We did enjoy, Escape from Gringotts, Flight of the Hippogriff, the Hogwarts Express, the Wand show at Ollivander's (one of my daughters was chosen!) we tried butter beer and the girls tried some spells with the interactive wands. I don’t think the interactive wands work that well. So my advice is to have a game plan of what are things you must do or see, get their early and hit up your main attractions immediately and skip the express pass!"
820,2018-11,"I didn't actually visit here in April 2019 but that's the only year I had to choose from. I actually visited here in April 2015 for my High School Senior Trip. It was amazing!! I remembered coming here with my family back when I was like 12/13 years old and it didn't have half of what it has now, for example, the new Harry Potter World is friggin' awesome!"
821,2018-11,My 11 year old and I went last summer and the trip was great. We stayed at Adventura which was clean and an easy walk to parks but the rooms are quite small. I would strongly suggest you do a vip tour not the high dollar one which I did not do but the less expensive one was well worth the money even with the fact we did not ride all the rides chosen. If you have any motion sickness stay off the simpsons ride I was ill for the rest of the night even taking Dramamine before.
822,2018-11,"Everyone ran to diagon alley but we took our time and explored. So many great things to see. The Horror make up show was fantastic. Sang along with the blues brothers and had my picture taken with scooby doo. Then ate and drank in Springfield with the Simpson's. Rode MIB, shrek, minions and my person favorite...The Mummy. What a fantastic 2 days."
823,2018-11,Perfect park for Harry Potter’s fans & Grinch’s. Also enjoy roller coasters. Family favorite kids and adults attractions.
824,2018-11,"I finally went on the Harry Potter ride 10 years after it opened. Went on Hagrid’s motorcycle ride. Very fun. Warning, if you are a very large and tall person, you will not fit on Hagrid’s ride. The person I was with had to step off. Disappointing."
825,2018-11,One of my favorite days ever! Harry Potter World is the best thing going here. Need dual park passes to enjoy to the fullest.
826,2018-11,"Loved all of this place, was a once in a lifetime trip for us with 4 generations of our family and all of them thought this was great"
827,2018-11,"Great place for rides, shopping, exhibits, etc.. We were there during a rare slow time and got to ride all rides with no waiting. Rode several twice. No rushing and really enjoyed the parks."
828,2018-11,"We have been coming to this park since our kids were teenagers and 11 years later we still come as a family along with our seven-year-old granddaughter. The most popular part of Universal is definitely the Harry Potter theme area. It gets busy fast so head there first if you are interested. I don’t have any interest in Harry Potter but it was still really cool to go into this area. We missed the entrance to this so pay attention to the map. When you enter, you are in a whole different world. You feel like you are actually in the books\movies. Make sure to try some butterbeer (we prefer frozen) and ride Harry Potter and the escape from Gringotts! If you’re a fan of The Simpsons, there are rides, restaurant, and a whole section dedicated to the show. The rip rocket is a fun roller coaster and you get to pick the music you want to listen to while on it. The Men in Black ride is another favorite and if you go in as a single rider instead of a group, you get on quicker and avoid the longer lines. If you are in a wheelchair, you can ride this. Universal studios has 3-D / 4-D attractions that I was able to go into with my wheelchair. They include the Despicable Me Minion Mayham, Shrek, and The Jimmy Fallon ride. There are other rides and shows that will help fill up your day also. We usually spend the shorter day at Universal and we will spend a longer day at Islands of adventure. There’s no way we could ever do both parks in a day with our whole family so we always get the 2 day 2 park pass. We always make sure to catch the Halloween horror make up show and The Animal Actors on location. Both are great for all ages and very entertaining. The animal show uses rescue animals and showcases their different talents! Some of them have even been in movies or TV shows. My husband is a big Blues Brothers fan and they have a cool little show with actors singing songs from the movie. The universal superstar parade is also worth checking out while characters from different movies and shows dance and sing. There are several different theme restaurants to check out. They are not cheap when it comes to their meals. However, they have a family meal deal and a refillable cup deal. The refillable cup deal is great and definitely saves money on drinks! You are allowed to bring in bottled water, sandwiches, bags of chips, etc. (full details on website). This is definitely a money saver."
829,2018-11,"Ok, so second visit to the park, first one was ten years earlier. There were plenty of updates, and the beauty of some of the rides were that we couldn't remember them fully so we were still surprised.  We really enjoyed Gringots, Transformers, Jimmy Fallon, The Mummy, but most of the Blues Brothers performances. That is to name our personal favourites, but it is all great.  We were lucky to be there through the Mardi Gras shows, which were spectacular."
830,2018-11,"We visited for a full day, mainly because our kids are really into Harry Potter and wanted to see the Wizarding World. You have to buy tickets for two of the parks in order to see both parts of it. This was a HUGE expense when that's really the only reason you are even visiting. I had hoped that the rest of the park would have some great things that our family would enjoy to help make up for what we paid, but unfortunately, that was not the case at all. The only thing we enjoyed was the Harry Potter portion, and even with that one of the rides the kids really wanted to go on was broken so they missed it. Had I realized we only part of the parks we would enjoy was the Wizarding World, for the cost we would have skipped Universal and just gone to Disney again instead."
831,2018-11,"The Universal Studios VIP experience is the only way to visit Universal Studios!! Our tour guide was Logan. Logan is knowledgeable, full of life, fun, informative and an absolute joy to be around!! We saw all of Islands of Adventure and rode all the rides with 0 wait time in 4 hours. Words cannot express how awesome this experience was!!"
832,2018-11,"We visited 2nd week in January and it was a good time without long lines. We ranged in age from 63 - 68 and had a great time. Rides are so immersive and the park is well designed so not too much walking. Lots of places to sit if you need a break and take out areas for food and drink. The only thing my friends complained about was the jerky movement o many of the rides was hard on the back, even though none of us have chronic issues. I love the parks and prefer Universal to Disney."
833,2018-11,"I’ve been to Universal several times and love it. The Harry Potter areas are particularly wonderful, full of detail and awesome rides. This is the first time that I’ve gone since having a child. We really went for my 6 year old nephew, and I knew going into it that my 2 year old wouldn’t be able to ride most of the rides. But good God, he can’t go on the rides in Seuss Landing?! Why make an area of the park for children and then make the height requirements so ridiculous. I’m not one of those parents who isn’t worried about safety either. I’ve been on all of the rides and cannot fathom why they wouldn’t allow a child his age on the Cat in the Hat. He can’t even go to the Minion Mayhem show. It’s literally a movie theater that kind of vibrates when something funny happens on screen. Really?...the only conclusion that I can come up with is that they really, really don’t want children in the parks. Thankfully, Disney is not nearly as ridiculous."
834,2018-11,We spent one day at Universal with our son and his family. We spent so much time walking and standing in line that we didn’t enjoy it much. Also I got sick after eating at one of the restaurants. I don’t think we will go back again.
835,2018-11,Amazing place to visit and takes pictures everywhere. Super magic and fabulous park in Orlando......
836,2018-11,"Our family of four really liked Diagon Alley. The entire area seems right out of the books/movies, which is a great experience. We really liked Gringotts Bank and Knockturn Alley. A must do is to take the train between the two Harry Potter areas. We also really liked the Kong Ride. Hulk Coaster is a classic ! We'll be back !"
837,2018-11,"Universal is still a great theme park. I have enjoyed the changes they have made over the years with replacing Jaws and Back to the Future, however I feel the new rides are becoming more of the same. 4D rides, with big screens. I hope they bring some new rides in the future."
838,2018-11,"We had a great couple of days here. Its great just to walk around here. Much slower pace than disney, the rides are excellent and the special effects are awesome. We watched the the light and projection show at the end of the evening was great."
839,2018-12,"We spent two fun filled days at these two parks over a busy holiday weekend. Here are some tips to help you for your future trip experience.  First things first. You need to decide what are the important stops and then plan your experience around that. For us it was visiting everything and anything to do with Harry Potter. We wanted to get here, check out the wands and robes on day one (so the kiddos could use them at the parks). But let’s not get ahead of ourselves just yet...we need to get you into the park first.  There are multiple ways to purchase your tickets either on their website, with a travel agent like me or through another website like AAA. Here is what I recommend, get your tickets anyway you like (through me is the best way) on your mobile app or paper. The will call area to pickup your actual tickets can be a bit confusing. Also in my observation during the time I was there, most confirmations numbers did not work on the machine and you had to wait in another line for a ticket specialist to help you. Yes, we were one of these special people. It took them about an hour to fix our tickets and it was very frustrating as time was ticking away.  Ticket Tip: Express ticket/passes are separate from your ticket price and need to be purchased in addition to the park admission price. This can be quite costly as there are different levels for purchase. The express passes save on the long line waits and in a way very worth it but your ticket price almost doubles. So you have to weigh out what works best for you. But recommendation is to purchase park to park ticket. That is the only way to ride The Hogsworth Express from Harry Potter to the Wizard World of Harry Potter. The train ride is super fast and it’s a great experience for little witches and wizards. You feel like your in London as you enter the Kings Cross station and all staff stays in character to round out the experience.  Few differences between Universal and Disney. Universal gives you these paper cards - not a fan as they are easy to loose. Disney gives you magic bands which you wear and if staying on property you can charge food, beverages and merchandise back to your room. We love our magic bands but are very used to this process.  Park hours. Universal opens and closes with shorter times to stay in the parks. Typical day is 9am to 8 pm with fewer options for early access. Disney has greater time lengths with parks opening on average 8 am and staying open until 10 pm. Disney has spectacular fireworks and light shows at night too. But both parks have extra park hours for those staying on property of an hour before.  Food and beverage options are vast and each section of the park offers a variety of food themed to that area. But some must try’s are: butter beer, cauldron cakes, fish & chips can be found in both Harry Potter areas; Holmer’s Big Donut in Simpson’s area; giant turkey legs can be found all over but we got ours in Jurassic Park area and so on... There are choices for everyone. A few good restaurant choices are Vivo, Italian; Mythos, Mediterranean; Bubba Gump Shrimp Factory in Citigroup Walk; Amatista Cookhouse in Loews Sapphire Falls Resort but wherever you choose to eat the food quality is amazing and so is the service. Tip: if you book a package of room and tickets then you can make dining reservations. Otherwise it’s first come for tables. Few options are on open table but every little bit helps!   Harry Potter tips: Wands can be purchased at Oliveranders and there are two lines. One brings you to an experience show where the choose one child to be a part of the show and they explain how the wand chooses it person. Then you enter the wand shop where wands guides assist with asking you questions to aid in picking the perfect wand for you! The other door just takes you into the shop. There are two styles of wands - one that interacts with areas of the parks where your little wizard can turn on a fountain to flush a toilet so a spell and flick of the wrist. The other do not interact and are a higher quality. Or you can just pick a wand from one of your favorite characters too. They come with a map to help you find the locations that are inactive too.  There are tons of shops to find chocolate frogs, ice cream, apparel, gifts, bags, etc. Ride attractions in these areas are a must do as they all are equally as awesome but you must ride the new Motorcycle Rollercoaster. So cool and that’s all I can tell you - no spoiler alerts here.  The rest of the parks are divided into various lands. But some cool rides for thrill seekers are the Hulk Rollercoaster, Hollywood Rollercoaster which you choose your own music and takes a video of your ride (that’s hilarious!), minions, fast and furious, skull island, transformers , Jimmy Kimball race around New York.  Few last tips: download the Universal Orlando App on your phone. Be sure to upload your tickets and everyone who is in your party. This is ideal if you lose your tickets and an easy way to retrieve them. Also you can check wait times for rides, directions throughout the park, food options and so much more!  Need help planning your trip? Reach out to Posh Travel Destinations and we can assist you with all of your planning needs from which ticket to purchase, where to stay on and off property and what are the must stop dining locations.   Bon voyage,  ~ Felicia, xoxo"
840,2018-12,"Loved it. There is no better way to describe IT. All staff were amazing, friendly and knowledgeable.  **UNIVERSAL STUDIOS**  It's a shame you need to pay so much, just for one park - Young families would be better off in Universal Studios, it's more 3 or 4D shows and kiddo rides like Spiderman, Men in Black, Simpsons, Minions, Shrek and so on.  Spiderman was definitely a favorite so I'm not knocking it - VERY IMMERSIVE (so was the Mummy!)  DISAPPOINTED.. Once inside Universal Studios, I soon realised we'd chosen the wrong Park (I'm 27 and went with my 43 year old dad)  I got to see Spiderman outside his ride longside all of your marvel favorites though, thay was pretty cool! They came past everyone riding wicked motorbikes waving at the kids etc.. Yes you can meet them if you check out the map and times etc  ONLY BIG RIDE in U.S was the rocking roller coaster - Must say it was one of my favorites though!! YOU EVEN GET TO CHOOSE YOUR OWN SONG TO ROCK TO!!!  Must see... Harry Potter escape Gringots, Diagon Alley - good luck finding it) Fast and Furious, Spiderman, Return of the Mummy, Men in Black, Rocking Roller Coaster, Transformers and Dr Dooms Fear Fall!!!  **ISLAND OF ADVENTURE **  WATER RIDES.. YOU WILL GET SOAKED not just a little.. I walked round in wet trainers all afternoon! Would definitely take a towl or swimmers next time*****  I spent most of the day in this park, after I upgraded my ticket...  HAGRIDS Motorbike ride was my favorite by far. I couldn't believe it! You get to 60 miles per hour a few times over, see mystical creatures, visit the forest and much more!!! The rest of the Harry Potter rides were also incredible and very Immersive!! *****very long queues, quieter at lunch time, no fast track, but single riders will get you to the front slightly quicker*****  I just loved this park from King Kong to Jurassic to the Hull and everything else.  BE PREPAIRED... Wear comfy shoes and take change of clothes or wear swimmers for the water rides!! Maybe even a towel. I did 23k steps in total and couldn't walk afterwards - probably because of the wet trainers I was walking in all afternoon.  Most rides I queued for an average if 10 mins. Hagrids was about 2 hours!! Worth it though so DO NOT GET PUT OFF BY THE WAIT, IT IS MORE THAN WORTH IT.  I wanted to visit here since I was 10. 17 years later, was soooo worth the wait!!!!  If your not a rides person, you can get lost in the shops and restaurants or go on the rides in universal, 3d glasses and Immersive but not scary at all."
841,2018-12,"My wife and I visited Universal Studios in late January on a weekend we thought wouldn’t be busy. Unknown to us, the park moved the Rock the Universe event onto that same weekend. It was way busier than normal unfortunately. The people were also very rude in line sometimes. Otherwise, we had a great time! We rode Revenge of the Mummy a bunch of times since it was my favorite. Some other highlights were Shrek, Men in Black, and Gringotts. Some of the 4D motion rides tended to make me dizzy and queasy but that is just me. My wife was completely fine on those rides. Overall, we loved visiting and plan to come back again in the future!"
842,2018-12,"Very cool park, the minions, Tranformers, fast and furious and Shrek are the best ones, must visit, also has the new area of harry potter’s world with a new ride is amazing too!Must go!"
843,2018-12,"We were staying in one of the on-site hotels, so managed to get in early and see the amazing Wizarding world Harry Potter experience nice and early before the crowds. I certainly suggest this as a great way to do it, but as soon as the park opens ""properly"" we moved on to some of the older rides.  We really like the 3D experience rides... Shrek, Transformers, Kong and Fast+Furious are all worth a bit of time stood in line."
844,2018-12,"We had a wonderful day. Wednesday so only small queues and crowds. Red Rocket, Mummy Returns and Spider-Man are stars of the show. Get a 2-day 1 park ticket as you will want to go to Islands of Adventures too - else you will be disappointed."
845,2018-12,"I have not been to universal since the days of Kong earthquake and jaws. I was impressed with the parks changes. Wizarding World of Harry Potter ups the game on themed entertainment. The wand experience was great and the wizards and witches helping the young ones complete their spells were fantastic. Food was great. My son is 4 and I wasnt sure what he’d think of the rest of the park but he loved it. He went on woody woodpecker coaster 6 times. We went in Feb crowds were low and wait times were usually the time it takes to get through the queue. Mardi Gras parade and food were great. Glad they still had et, I loved that ride when I was a kid. If traveling with young ones make sure you check the heights before booking. My 4 y/o didn’t make it on some rides like MIB."
846,2018-12,"We took our kids(5,8) to Universal while we were on vacation and opted to spend a little more and get the VIP tour. It was an extra $189 added into the $160 ticket, it included breakfast and lunch.   When we arrived it was 9am and our tour started at 9:30a. We parked valet(included in price of VIP ticket) and asked where to go. There was a walk to a small cafe for breakfast, no one showed us how to get there or escorted us to the cafe. It was a little bit of a walk and some confusion on where to go but we found it! The girl that greeted us was very nice, showed us where our table was and sat us down with a couple of families. We were confused because there was open tables and she didn’t say “Hey! These guys will be on your tour with you also!” She just walked away lol. The breakfast was fine, nothing fantastic. Had all the basics..eggs, bacon, bagels, pastries etc. Our tour guide showed up and asked what we were excited to do today and if we had any preferences. We did say we wanted to do the Jurassic ride, but told us it was too cold for that. So, we couldn’t go on.  We started our tour right at 9:30a. Our guide was super nice! She took us right to our first ride and from there we didn’t stop for 7 hours. We did 12 rides total. It was a lot. I was hoping to go to a show or something to break up the rides but there was no break except for lunch(45min). By the time we were done I think everyone had an upset stomach because of all the rides and running around for 7 hours. My 5 year old was so tired and so wasn’t my 8yr old that they didn’t even want to stay for the Super Hero dinner we had planned, they just wanted to leave.  I do like that she got us in front of all the lines and we literally didn’t have to wait at all. But, in the future they should take a survey on what people expect out of the experience. Our group was not ride focused 100%, and our tour guide was. She had us running all over and everyone was just exhausted by the end. I think we would of all liked to have time to stop and take some pictures, try some butter beer etc.  Over all it was fun! And my oldest really enjoyed it. The tour guide answered every single question he had and was so kind to him. She never once got annoyed with him lol. We would def do it again!"
847,2018-12,"A wonderful day in the park from beginning to end. Arrived just as the park opened and walked directly to the back to Harry Potter. The wait was not crazy and the ride was exciting. Recommended rides include Transformers, Race Through NYC, Revenge of the Mummy and ET. Parking costs $27 and it is a long walk from the garage to the parks. They do have moving sidewalks."
848,2018-12,"January was an excellent time to visit. With express passes, we got to enjoy the park with minimal lines. Rides were fun, especially the 3D. I don’t do roller coasters so I can’t comment on those. We got a multi-park ticket for Harry Potter and we were glad we did."
849,2018-12,"We did Universal studio and Adventure Park in one day! We got here at 8AM and were done both parks at 3:30 pm. We did visit in January which is low season, so it was not that crowded and we got through lines very quick. If you are looking for adventure and want o live your childhood memories and dreams THIS IS THE PLACE!"
850,2018-12,"We had lots of fun. We enjoyed so much, and now we have memories that will be with us forever. An amazing place"
851,2018-12,I could go in almost all the toys there. It’s a wonderful park. All the toys are thematic from the line to the central toy. And this provides amazing experience.
852,2018-12,"Better waiting times than Disney, but we ended up getting Express ticket - that is, we paid double. In the end, it was good to save time, but probably pointless. Visit the top 5, wait the 1h for each, and then you're done. The rest is just all the same. Avoid minions, it's for children, rubbish. And go after you visit Disney, as the crowd, despite being horrible, won't bother as much since Disney is like a nightmare."
853,2018-12,loved it here!!! rides so good variety for everyone but drinks and food expensive but just like all the parks i recommend fast past
854,2018-12,Great rides especially Kong and Jurassic Park!!! Crowded but expected. Park well maintained and clean. Be prepared to walk!!!
855,2018-12,We love all universal theme parks including the rides and entertainment. However we decided to pay extra to experience the Halloween fright night. Very disappointed. Queues very long to get into each fright experience building and then to many people inside. You can see the creatures jumping out at the people in front so no surprise when they do it to you. The costumes and scenes were professional. Not worth the money and due to time scale not sufficient time to see everything. I suggest they reduce number of ticket sales.
856,2018-12,I would say its amazingggg ... i was on saturday night and there were few diferent concerts and it was soo nice to be there. Recomend to everyone once in a lifetime you should go here
857,2018-12,"We went at the end of January. The temps were chilly in the mornings and evenings, but very nice once the sun got up and going. Jeans and long sleeved shirts would probably be enough for most people but, if you’re cold natured, take a light jacket or sweater. Going early in the year avoids the crowds of Summer. I think the longest we waited for any ride was twenty minutes. For most of them, we walked all the way to the front of the ride without stopping."
858,2018-12,"1. Bring your own food and drinks. No issues getting through security and the stuff in the park (although tastes great!) costs a small fortune. Buy a re-fillable cup...can be used every day at Universal Parks for a daily fee. 2. Don’t buy souvenirs at the Parks. Go to your closest Walmart. They have souvenirs for Disney and Universal (authentic) but MUCH CHEAPER. $13 for lanyard at Universal, $5 at Walmart.... ! 3. Speaking of lanyards, buy one before you go to put your express passes in. Then you don’t have to worry about losing them or digging into your wallet, purse, bag every time you ride. 4. Go EARLY. Parks aren’t open as long as you might think, so get your moneys worth. 5. Don’t rent a stroller, go to Walmart and spend $20. Give it to someone when you’re finished. $18/day for 5 days adds up! 6. Lastly, but most important, if you can (they aren’t cheap) BUY AN EXPRESS PASS and do it the day you go to each park (many times it is cheaper than getting online). These are worth their weight in gold. The time you save waiting in line can range from 15 minutes to over and hour. Don’t bother with one for Volcano Bay, they have a virtual line up, so you can play while you wait. But a must for Universal and Island! Had much happier kids than when we went to Disney without one!! It’s a great place to visit, my three year old was a bit to small to really enjoy it, I would recommend age 8+. Fab rides and spectacular visuals everywhere. Highly recommended!"
859,2018-12,"We spent 5 days exploring both parks and I really enjoyed Studios. Love the Hollywood and San Fran parts, lots of fun 4D rides and enjoyed The Simpsons section  Again, I deducted one star as I feel the daily parking rate of $26USD is a bit much, considering how much you already pay for admission"
860,2019-1,Harry Potter was amazing! It was absolute perfection! The rest of the parks are very fun as well. Everyone is friendly and it is clean
861,2019-1,Universal studios is amazing. It’s a wonderful day out to spend with family making amazing memories. Loved it.
862,2019-1,There is a lot to pack in here and recommend starting with the Harry Potter attraction first because you will want to spend a lot of time there. Stay at a Universal-related hotel for an hour early admission. BIG benefit! Be aware that many of the rides are immersive 3D rides with a lot of rocking and rolling. They do a good job of putting you in the scenes but after a while they can get a bit repetitive. A fun experience overall and a totally different vibe than Disney. Much more adult-centric here.
863,2019-1,"We stayed at the Lowes Hotel connected to Universal Studios. If you can do it, its best to stay in one of the connected hotels. They are close. We were able to take the water taxi or walk to the park in minutes with little or no lines. Universal was unbelievable. We walked 26 miles in three days. It was a blast for the whole family. We were there at Christmas time including Christmas Day so keep in mind it was crowded. With the early/easy pass we were able to get in early and avoid lines on our favorite rides or attractions. The Harry Potter areas were very popular with children and you adults. We also purchased the meal plan that worked out well except we didn't eat enough times and had some left over meals or snacks. The employees were incredibly nice every where we went. It wasn't the cheapest vacation but if you can do it once, your children will remember forever."
864,2019-1,"Universal Orlando was supposed to be an awesome place to have spent my vacation...until we legitimately got robbed by people we thought were security people. We get stopped by these three individuals acting as security and they forcefully took my hubby away thinking he stole items from one of the shop. I was so scared but I legit thought they were one of those people who were just doing their job (don’t even ask me why we didn’t stop to ask for ID as they were forcing themselves and surrounded my family to make it look like my hubby had stolen stuff, IT WAS SCARY!) So I waited for my hubby to come back as I didn’t know where they had taken him. He comes back shaken and then realizes they had stolen from him as he and others were asked to check their items in their bags with receipts. This is while those thieves took his other bags while he wasn’t looking. It wasn’t just him this happened to, others had it happen to them too at the same time. Long story short, my hubby was so traumatized by this and after getting his head straight, he called Universal security to which they said they can’t do anything about what happened because apparently what happened was like some kind of organized crime ring and it happened to unsuspecting people like us...tourists from another country. Like how the eff can this park let this happen and do nothing about it???? We spent good money to be at a park like this, and although the items are just items that can be replaced, what would’ve happened if those people including my hubby got hurt in the process??? What then???? He got scared and didn’t know what to do but do as he was asked by again those people acting like security people and this whole experience at the theme park left a very sour taste in our mouths. I just cannot believe Universal Orlando says they can’t do nothing about what happened!!! I’m not asking for anything or compensation but I wish the theme park can be more understanding of the situation this put us in. We had two more days in our pass but my hubby refuses to go because the whole experience of being robbed and thinking he was guilty of something he didn’t do, made him feel that the park is unsafe to be in, which is the case. I just hope no one else has this happen to them. And I really wish Universal Orlando would be more understanding of this situation and those this has affected. Oh and because we had the items paid for in cash, unless we had proof we bought items there is nothing they can do which I think is a load of BS. They make so much money and compensating those who got affected by any means would’ve been the least they can do to take some of the sour taste of this experience away. I want everyone to know, DO NOT PAY FOR ANYTHING WITH CASH! Because they won’t reimburse you for the items stolen (which again is understandable) but still. Being unsuspectingly be robbed is not a great feeling and I want everyone to know that if it can happen to us, it can happen to you! I should’ve listened to my gut when this happened because the way those three individuals acted it did seem they were gonna rob us but then we got fooled into thinking they were security and this happened because we were so scared."
865,2019-1,Universal is fun and a little more laid back than the bigger mouse oriented parks (not that I don't enjoy them- i just find it a little stressful) which make you reserve stuff way in advance... my visits always allow for a little more flexablity and relaxation since i don't have to be running around on a schedule.
866,2019-1,"We love to visit Universal Studios. I had read many bad reviews lately about security but they checked our bags at all the entrances. Most all the employees were very nice and helpful. Most of the lines moved quickly and the laser light show was neat to see. There were a few complaints we had that the park needs to improve upon. First and foremost the park hours. As much as you pay to get in and they close the park at 6PM and 7PM??? WHAT! One night closed at 6PM for a private party. Why should all the people who paid full price have to leave early because of a private party. This should be AFTER HOURS! Weekend hours were 8PM. The park hours should be at the very least until 8PM every night. Secondly, all the restruants and food venders close an hour before closing. So on a night they close at 6 all the food vendors are shut down at 5. Again...poor planning on Universal's part. Food should be served up until at least closing time. Don't send your customers away hungry. Thirdly, I love that the parks open early and have fast passes for those who stay in the resorts but only one park is open early. Shouldn't it be both? So past those few things we were happy and had fun. The park was also very clean and maintaince on rides shut down were announced a head of time."
867,2019-1,So much better then Disney. I didn't feel rushed all day. So much more laid back and enjoyable. Harry Potter is amazing.
868,2019-1,"Have been here a few times a really great park that you have to visit while in Orlando lots to do plenty of restaurant choices, have been to Halloween horror nights and had a fabulous time would recommended and I shall be returning from the uk in the near future"
869,2019-1,"We took part in a team building event in the park, which gave us an opportunity to see all the park, as well as the end of day show.  The park is smaller than I expected, but good fun. Typical theme park prices inside ($12.99 for a hot dog, $5.99 for a small bottled drink...).  Loads to see and do at the park - and a recommended day out.  The show at the end of the day is worth hanging around for."
870,2019-1,"Thank you to the staff for making my bday so special... I was given a bday badge and was greated everywhere with a friendly happy birthday. Thank you to Norma in Kristy's burgers for showing us the mobile app food booking (life saver). And Kim in the monster cafe for making me feel so special on my bday, so friendly and helpful. Harry potter areas amazing, fast pass a must.. beets Disney hands down. The wand pairing was a lovely touch so happy I was chosen to partake. The night bus Conductor was funny as was Earl. Highly recommended."
871,2019-1,"Visiting in the second week of January, we were pleasantly surprised with generally short queue times and fantastic weather with which to visit the park. Being our second visit, we were able to target particular rides, and make the most of a single day visit. This place is really a wonderland, fantastic rides, good if expensive eating options, and I would definitely return. Great mix of rides suitable for all ages, and street shows such as Blues Brothers and Marilyn. Family favourite is still The Mummy. Would return for that. The cost is high, but as far as theme park goes, you get what you pay for, and you get a lot here."
872,2019-1,"Hi. Our experience in Hagrid’s Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure today was the worst memory ever. We wait more tham 90 min, my kid RAFAELA BASTIAN was measured 3 times before our turn and all of them say “ok, have a great ride” for her. The last staff, before 90 min waiting, tell us that she isn’t tall enough! Why let her wait so long? Why others staffs tells that she can? Why they are so cruel with her? If the first guy told us that she is not tall enough we will lose our time in other part but they prefer lie to us until the time of the ride! Very sad pay a lot of money, spend a lot of time To see my Kid cry like that. You destroyed our magic Hogwarts memories today."
873,2019-1,All the rides we went on were great. There weren’t a lot of people so we didn’t have lines but I would be frustrated at having to wait in a 2 hour line for a 30 second ride.
874,2019-1,"Last week I went with my friend (both of us in our 60's) to Universal Studios to see the Harry Potter parks. I do not like rides but she does. We spent 5 days (Monday-Friday) in the parks. We were hoping to avoid the crowds by going mid-week, and despite MLK Day on Monday, it wasn't bad. The weather Monday-Thursday was really cold and windy (Universal can't help the weather) but the weather meant that the rooftop bar at our hotel (Aventura) was closed, and several of the rides were closed on certain days during certain times.  Pros: Harry Potter World was so very well done. Although I don't like rides, several of the rides includes ""shows"" while you wait, so I waited with my friend as she walked through Gringotts and Hogwarts, which was awesome. For riders, they typically have a ""single rider"" option, so if you don't mind sitting by yourself, it's a lot quicker through the line as a single rider. Since we were there 5 days, we went to other areas (Suessland was visually stunning) and went to as many shows as we could. Employees were incredibly helpful, friendly and patient (they must get the same request for directions 1000 times but they are just as kind with everyone.) On Friday, the only warm day, I went to Volcano Bay and it was incredible. The water was warm and the beach was awesome.  The dragon in HP blows fire randomly throughout the day, and only on Thursday did we catch the fire-blowing, which takes about 3 seconds. There are also secret magic windows where you can use your wand (other windows have a marker on the ground in front of them.)  Cons: Food. Generally, the same extremely overpriced food (bad burgers and fries) is served throughout the parks and it's not good. At Harry Potter, you have to have butter beer ($8 for 16 ounces) (tastes like sweet butterscotch soda), but we went to breakfast at the Leaky Caldron (potatoes swimming in grease) and at the three Broomsticks (tasteless pasty). We found a good breakfast at the Today Cafe, and a good dinner at Grill and Brew in City Walk. Even snacks were ridiculous- $3 for a bag of chips. Universal can do a lot better. Side note- if you pay for your park ticket with your American Express card, you can use the AMEX lounge. It's a tiny room and there's not much there but it is air conditioned, a bathroom (single occupancy) has free chips and granola bars and small water bottles.  We went to the Horror Film Make-up show, which was generally pretty good. The presenters (a ""funny"" make up artist and a straight man) geared the show toward kids (plenty of fart jokes Hardy-har) but adults were entertained as well. However, and it's a big however, they made a racist joke (one audience volunteer was from Ecuador and the ""funny"" guy make a joke that we better not make her upset- she's from Ecuador and she'll ""cut you"".) and a completely inappropriate joke about women's biology (""Latex and Playtex are different- they create different monsters"" Yuk yuk.) These are the kind of comments that, if made in front of my children, I would stand up against and let my children and the commenter know that these are disrespectful. Unfortunately, in the middle of the show no one was going to do that. I'm guessing that the Playtex joke went over the kids' heads, but I still felt disrespected and hope Universal will take notice and educate their presenters that these types of jokes are disrespectful, perpetuate a stereotype, and should be avoided.  Ride closures: We ran into one couple who were in for one day, They stood in line for Hagrid's ride for almost 2 hours, when the ride was shut down for technical difficulties. they were about 50 people from the front of the line. The announcement was that they weren't sure when the ride would reopen. There should be some method for accommodating people when the rides close and they have invested so much time waiting. Something like a ""front of the line voucher"" could be used."
875,2019-1,Loved it here....better rides..not over crowded..less time waiting....better restaurants....keep it up guys....fantastic
876,2019-1,"I visited the park on a Monday. The wait times were amazing. I rode almost all the rides in the park. All the rides were so much fun, especially the 3D rides. There was something for all ages. The staff was very friendly. The 2pm parade was great. The different tv show characters came out around 4 pm. You could also take pictures with them. Some of the characters were Homer & Bart Simpson, Dora & Diego, Scooby & Shaggy, Marilyn Monroe and Betty Boop to name a few. It was great to see the kids and adults excited about seeing the characters. I had a blast and I can’t wait to go back."
877,2019-1,Finally a park where teens can enjoy themselves too! My daughter had a great time much more energetic than Disney for older teens!
878,2019-2,Everything is good!! VERY WELL ORGANIZED!! GO AND HAVE FUN!! It is much better than other disney parks.
879,2019-2,We came out for our honeymoon and we really had a great time. We didn’t stay at a universal hotel but our own villa and went to all the parks. We spent most of our time at universal as we found it the best park. It’s well worth doing universal and islands of adventure because there’s a lot to take on at both. The theming in universal is better but the rides are better in islands of adventure. There’s only two good rollercoasters at universal mummy and rip ride rocket (the queue adverts need to be updated on this one as they are very annoying) Most of the rest is 4D which is ok but not my thing. Was disappointed that the only nod to Jaws was the statue I was kinda hoping in the closing fireworks display he might pop up. Still really good though
880,2019-2,"The best rides are the Mummy, Escape from Gringott's, and Rip Rocket. Most of the rides are simulators."
881,2019-2,"Just visited Universal Studios this past week. The weather in FL was very cold and windy. Most of the rides were closed due to the weather. Harry Potter experience was awesome for what we were able to do, 1 of the rides was closed for the 3 days we were there. We had arrived earlier than expected on Monday so we decided to go to the parks for a couple of hrs. On Thursday the weather was beautiful and all rides were open besides 1, so we went to the park stood in line over half hour for them to tell us that our passes expired. Due to the 3 day pass only. They counted Monday as a full day when we were there for 2 hrs. So upset with this. Recommend but pay close attention to what package you purchase when visiting the parks."
882,2019-2,"The photo package is not worth it! I ended up with less than 10 photos for my money! We rarely saw a photographer! The photos we got were taken on the rides. If the photographers were there, they did not stand out. I would never do this again. Total waste of money!"
883,2019-2,"My husband and I visited Universal Studios Orlando last week. Not being riders of roller coasters or other motion sickness inducing experiences, we opted for a one day pass to the Universal Studios park, skipping Islands of Adventure and Harry Potter. First off, we were dismayed at the $26 daily parking fee. We feel a small fee is acceptable, but if guests are already paying a hefty entrance fee, price gouging on the parking is questionable. This was our first trip to Universal, and I had done some research before hand. Our favorite part was The Simpsons, which was cute and clever. We walked completely around City Walk, and ate lunch at the restaurant at the Simpsons. Lunch was fine, but we noticed the entire park was a little run down and dirty. Other than plenty of places to dine and buy souvenirs this park lacked anything much for us to do, since we didn’t ride any rides. One time will be enough for us."
884,2019-2,"As seniors we usually don't get too excted about rides especially roller coaster rides. However that said, the 3D rides of Transformers, Fast and Furious and The ride through New York with Jimmy Fallon open up a whole new adventure when it come to rides to thrill and amaze. It is without any doubt the first time that a ride makes you believe you could just reach out and touch. The Transformers ride is an absolute don't miss or you will regret your decision. It was pretty much the highlight of our entire outing."
885,2019-2,"In some ways, yes. The rides are more aggressive than most of what Disney offers, and the lines move faster. Of course you can also purchase a pass to bypass the lines, too. The best way to see all of the biggest attractions in one day is to purchase a guided tour."
886,2019-2,"I’m not really into theme parks anymore, but I had fun with my family at Universal. I was very impressed by the number of restrooms, as well as the cleanliness of the entire park. The rides were fun and innovative. We also went to the Horror Makeup show, which was really funny. Be prepared for long lines and lots of people . As long as you go in expecting some chaos, you’ll enjoy yourself."
887,2019-2,"For us this was better than Disney. There feels more to do here and at the time we traveled it was easier to get onto rides. We did both parks in one day relatively easy. Our son practically went on all the rides (we did get him a express pass). But our time at both Universal and Disney here in Florida and again in Los Angeles, Universal seemed easier to get onto rides (fast) and Disney is just very packed. Anyway - highly recommend Universal - great options for food - big range to choose from."
888,2019-2,"We spent five days in October with family at Disney World Orlando staying at the Pop Century Resort and three days two nights in January at Universal Orlando staying at the Hard Rock Hotel (club level). Both were quite expensive and you really need deep pockets for sure but Universal came out on top in our opinion. Disney's rides were more varied but we enjoyed the Hogwart Express and various Harry Potter attractions more. The simulator rides at Universal were very similar to one another, but the Simpsons ride was the best. The water taxi which takes you to City Walk near Universal and Island of Adventure was very nice, and you can easily walk from Hard Rock Hotel to either park. Contrast that with Disney which has a bus system which requires you to walk forever before you even get into the park. Hard Rock has a restaurant, the Kitchen, at the hotel which is terrific while Disney's Pop Century has the most awful cafeteria food and no real restaurant. All the restaurants we tried at Universal and City Walk were nice with good food...we stayed at the Club level, 7th floor, at Hard Rock and that is the way to go if you can afford the rates...amenities like breakfast, snacks, evening beverages were really nice and you never had to leave your floor of the hotel at the end of a long day at the parks. You also get the Express Pass when you stay at Hard Rock which lets you skip the lines. We never waited for any rides at Universal, but it is also a slower time of year. Overall Universal would be our choice to do again. Also, other reviews mentioned workers who did not seem to care...we did not find that to be the case at all. Everyone at Hard Rock, Universal Studios and Island of Adventure was welcoming and helpful."
889,2019-2,"First ever visit at an age of 60+. So much to see. We only had one day in the area so opted for one park ticket which was expensive but you only live once. Enjoyed walking round and seeing the fascinating buildings. We went on many of the rides and although we had to queue did not seem to mind as so much going on around you. Enjoyed Harry Potter, but have to the studios in England and did prefer that. Again there was so much to see and had a butter beer. The only ride we did not enjoy was The Mummy because we did not realise it was a rollercoaster and was very fast, great if you like that sort of thing. Loved the Monster make up show, very funny and interesting learning the tricks of the make up artist. All in all a great day out and was walking distance from our hotel The Wyndham."
890,2019-2,"Already reviewed the other park. This one was a little better. This park has much wider streets and walkways compared to Islands of Adventures so you don’t quite feel like cattle being herded to your death. The rides are fun but only the really big thrill rides last a minute or more. Otherwise you wait in line 45 minutes for your kids to ride something for 20 seconds, that’s literal. We are pass holders at Disney so I know how expensive theme parks are. No outside food or drinks are allowed, so that $5 bottle is a necessity plus the food is more expensive too, if you can even stand in line long enough to get “quick service food”. But with a food allergy, I was annoyed that I couldn’t bring my own snacks in. It’s not like I didn’t spend over $1500 for two days of park time for my whole family, plus all the souvenirs. The restrooms were not clean, there was trash on the ground and I’m not used to that. Overall it was a huge disappointment and it will be 10 years before I’m willing to do it again to take our youngest child that was too small to go this time."
891,2019-2,"I was lucky enough to spend 2 1/2 days at Universal. I was stunned at how expensive the tickets were but thanks to my amazement and enjoyment of the two Harry Potter sections of the park (and I'm not even a huge fan) I'd have to say it was $ well spent. I'd recommend a half-day all park ticket if you can visit during the week but NOT on a holiday or school break time. If you have a whole day to spend and are more than a party of two, be there when the park opens and go for the express upgrade. You can easily do all three park sections very well with express and an entire day. Enjoy!"
892,2019-2,"Okay, if you have kids that just have to see the Harry Potter theme parks (half in Universal Studios and half in Universal Adventure Land - so you have to buy a 2-park pass), then I guess you have to bit the bullet. But for me, it was WAY overpriced for the value of entertainment. I wanted to ride the Hogwarts coaster, but was not prepared to wait 90 min - and that was in off season! Overpriced merchandise everywhere. $50 for a wand? I wanted to mail ONE post card. I would have had to buy a package of cards and a package of stamps - $30. Jimmy Fallon's Race Through New York was a blast. But, if I could do it all over again, - I wouldn't."
893,2019-2,Fun as always. This was the first time using the express pass to cut the line. We will never go back to waiting more than 20 minutes for a ride.
894,2019-2,"We love Universal Studios and Islands of adventure over Disney but we will not return to Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure. The family is going to be in Orlando for an upcoming weekend and have a day or two free. We looked at the costs of a 1 day ticket for Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure vs Disney park hoppers. It’s February so the water parks are off the agenda. We visited both parks last summer so we know what there is in both Universal and Disney. We counted the rides we were able to get on in our average one day vs ticket costs for each park. We did not add in any taxes, food, drink, parking or souvenir costs. Universal Studios and Islands of adventure worked out to around 30.00 a ride. Disney worked out to around 12.00 a ride. Both are very expensive but clearly Disney wins out and has more places to visit and see for less money. We were going/wanted to go to Universal and Islands of Adventure but this changes our minds completely. Guess who is now paying for all the overbuilt Harry Potter rides? Having rode them this summer I can say they or any ride there is just not worth 30 bucks a ride. I am sure the prices “improve” if you stay longer but do they? Longer stays result in more money spent with less to do then in the bigger Disney. So it’s really not a deal. I am not a huge fan of Disney either, so please don’t think I am. It’s just dollars and sense. Hey go to each place, have loads of fun and then afterwards do your own cost analysis. WHOEVER the looser is, dump them off your next trip to Orlando, sending them a clear message!"
895,2019-2,"There are 2 parks at Universal plus a water park. We skipped the water park (Volcano Bay) and went to Islands of Adventure and Universal (original). This was our second visit in three years. Universal, the original is more for those who want the ""movie"" experience. They have mostly 3D ""rides"" and the Harry Potter Escape from Gringotts (used to be located in the other park). The Hogwarts Express also runs through the park (but you have to have a 2 park ticket to ride the train). Be forewarned! On this side of the park, go early!! It's not as popular as the other park and even though we were there during the Christmas holidays, it was almost empty at 9:00 in the morning. But it gets really crowded later with minimum wait times of 100 minutes or longer. Fast passes probably would be helpful here, but we didn't want to pay the extra $70 - 90 p.p. We ended up going on many of the rides in this park. I think this is down to the (old-fashioned) rides not being able to accommodate the sheer volume of visitors at a brisk pace like the rides in the other park. Diagon Ally is incredibly crowded. They've done a superior job in replicating the town center, unfortunately, that kind of layout doesn't bode well for a mob of enthusiasts. On the bright side, the Gringotts ride was worth the 90 minute wait. We went there first thing, later it was a 205 minute wait! The food at the Leaky Cauldron was really good. The Islands of Adventure is geared towards the thrill seekers. Great rides and short(er) wait times. Hagrids motorbike ride is by far the best themed ride in the park. Buyer beware, as you might guess, gift shop prices are ridiculously expensive. It was a fun, but exhausting 2 days."
896,2019-2,"Spent 5 days in the 2 parks. Universal was great, the Gringotts ride was fun and the Dragon worth seeing but you have to catch it quick as it's over in seconds! Weather was good and mid week queues not too long. Bank Holiday weekend was predictably busy. Definitely fun for all the family even if you don't like the big rollercoasters. The Hogwarts Express is a great way to travel between parks. Looking forward to the next visit 😁"
897,2019-2,"Visited both Universal and Islands of Adventure in Jan with my two teenage sons. Although we only had one day we did a lot (most of the coasters) and enjoyed it. As overseas visitors it was quite expensive, but we all enjoyed it more than any of the Disney parks. Much better suited to teenagers."
898,2019-2,"We had a blast at Universal! We felt like kids again running through the park. Our favorite ride was Hagrid’s motorcycle ride in the Harry Potter section, which we rode twice. I would have paid for a ticket to visit Hogsmeade alone. So much fun! The only downsides were the crowds and the long wait times. Some of the rides closed their single rider line as well."
899,2019-3,"This was my favourite park of the holiday in the end but only because of being able to get into Harry Potter & other rides without an insane wait. At times, it was 90mins or longer for the popular rides but towards the start & end of the day's it was more like 20-40 mins waiting. If you can afford the express pass its worth it. Didn't manage to get on Hagrids Motorbike ride & this one isn't an express pass option but the other HP rides were amazing. Good to have free small lockers at relevant rides. Can take food in but not in a cooler. Can be a long walk from car to parks. Hogwarts train goes between the two & is well worth trying 8n both directions if the wait is not too bad. Note that Diagon Alley is hidden behind a wall, look for people wandering into it near the tube station. Huge crowds at all HP bits of the two parks. Tip: buy any two matinee tickets (between 11 & 6) on your way into the parks & get a refund on parking which makes it much cheaper ($15.98 instead of 26) & you can either go or not, we did see the film so effectively parked for free."
900,2019-3,"We stayed in Orlando & visited the studios & Islands of Adventure every day for 6 days. We had an amazing time, the staff were friendly & helpful, the interaction with the characters was incredible & only down side was very long queue's on some days but all in all it was better than expected plus we got to see the Macy's Christmas parade which was brilliant."
901,2019-3,"Arrived to Universal at approx 8:40am. Purchased tickets online in advance on arrival we had to wait in an extremely long line at will call to pick up tickets, Then again was directed to guest services to wait in an additional line to obtain a Disability Pass for my husband who suffers from severe PTSD from the Military and son who suffers from ADHD and ODD disorders. It was now approx 10:30am and we are just entering the park. Upon entering the park we walked through Dr Seuss area and were excited for the Harry Potter Area. The Harry Potter area seemed to be way over capacity and so crowded that you could not walk without someone running in to you let alone push my toddler in a stroller. After someone pushed into our stroller We tried to enter several stores/restaurants in this area to get out of the crowds and did not even have enough room to enter or push a stroller in. Several student groups were laying on the ground with book bags piled up and crowds trying to walk around them...this should not be allowed. We wanted to ride the Hagrid's Bike ride and using my husbands disability pass. We had a return time of 45 minutes so we sat and waited behind a close by store as my husband at this point was ready to leave due to all the chaos and his PTSD. It was time for us to enter the express line and we were in line for an additional 35 minutes setting in a tight dark cave packed with people clapping and screaming. My husband was ready to loose his mind as he was sitting on the floor with is head down. An announcement was then made the ride was closed due to technical difficulties and was not sure when it would reopen and we followed the crowd and found an exit. At this point my husband needed to get out of the Harry Potter area. We then went to ride the Jurassic Park Area and upon entering most of the Jurassic park section was blocked off for construction with high temporary walls and the Jurassic Park ride was closed. My son wanted to meet Blue...not surprised it was also down for technical issues for the rest of the day! At this point it is almost 1:30pm and we have done absolutely NOTHING but fight crowds and wait in lines to not ride anything. At this point my kids were crying and my husband was very upset so we started to walk out of the park. On our way our We did stop at Blondie's: Home of the Dagwood for lunch as we would not arrive back to our hotel for 45 minutes. I waited to get a table while my husband waited in line to order food. No one was wiping down the tables so I did using baby wipes. I had the Dagwood Sandwich only which was good, my husband and kids had the foot long hot dogs(small cold and stale bread) and my husband had a beer. Our total was $57.67! I expected high food prices but not for hot dogs that were awful! We finished walking out and decided to let our daughter ride a few rides back at the Dr Seuss area first. We went to the One Fish, Two Fish ride and got in line waited 20 minutes and surprise, the ride closed for technical difficulties!! My husband could not wait in another line at customer serve on our way out to talk to someone about our concerns. We both feel like we paid ALOT of money for tickets and also an Uber ride to and from All Star Sports resort Area."
902,2019-3,"Your trip would not be complete without this park. I personally liked it better than the Island of Adventure, which really surprised me. It has everything from rides to shows to great eats. There is a lot to take in so be prepared to spend more than one day to fully enjoy it. If visiting at peak season, splurge on the express pass for at least one day of your trip to skip the long lines you've been avoiding. I also suggest a park hopper for at least one day. It's nice to have the option to wander or take the Hogwarts Express to Island of Adventure. We utilized this more at the end of our trip to hit the rides here and there we missed."
903,2019-3,"Late December and lots of people but still well worth the visit. We had an exclusive pass that allowed us on ALL rides in BOTH parks so that was a blessing. I am a Central Florida resident and know when to go and when not to, if we didn't have a freind in upper management who got us in all rides from the back employee entrance, would have never gone. The roller coasters are fantastic and the Mummy is my fan favorite from the movie. Best of all, Hagrid's ride is absolutely the best."
904,2019-3,Loved loved loved it! Our kids loved it and even our little ones. They were so entertained which made for a well behaved day as well. They had a blast!
905,2019-3,"I like Universal Studios, it’s kept a happy balance of original with a healthy mix of modern and up-to date.  Ride wait times were not bad at all and during our visit managed to easily get on all the rides and the main roller coaster 3 times in quick succession.  There are plenty of pop up performances throughout the day too to break it up for you if you want entertainment whilst you stop for a while.  Food quality isn’t that great for the price and the portion sizes could use a little work.  The only real gripe Is with some of the rides themselves. There is a very similar theme throughout the majority of them along the lines of ‘escape from something’ or other. It’s mainly on the 4D rides which are ok, but the majority of the Universal Studios rides are now all of the. Same concept, something of personal preference I don’t enjoy as much as more traditional hands on full movement experiences."
906,2019-3,"I’m sharing a recent visit to Universal Orlando park where my family and I did the VIP tour. Thursday, December 5th, we arrived at the park approximately an hour early to check in and enjoy the breakfast. Both the breakfast and lunch were fantastic. Zac showed up and introduced himself as our tour guide before leading my family and one other on our tour.  We enjoyed the information given by Zac as we got to our first ride; however, we didn’t see anything that we wouldn’t have seen if we were a regular guest at the park. We quickly learned to stand a few feet from Zac as he tends to spit when he talks. That’s not meant as an insult, but people paying good money for a tour don’t want to be spit on all day. Between rides, he moved very slowly. The park was not crowded, most waits for rides were under 15 minutes, and we felt we lost time enjoying the park due to the slow transition from attraction to attraction, especially when he was on his cell phone (which was often). By 1130, the other family in our group decided to leave the tour and venture on their own. I don’t know their reason for this, but looking back on the day, we definitely could have experienced more of the park had we done the same.  After the other family left, I told Zac our main focus was riding rides, and we wanted to visit the prop room. We didn’t care as much for information, we specifically bought the VIP expecting a larger crowd at the park, and thus purchased it for the unlimited express pass and front of the line ability. Zac stated he understood and could get us through the 14 rides he was allowed to take us on and be done by 1430. We went to lunch shortly after this. Once he returned, I expected the pace to pick up. It did not. Between every ride my kids and I would be out in front of him. We would have to turn around, stop, and wait for him to tell us which way we were going. At the two large coasters, The Hulk and The Red Rocket, he belittled two of my children for being scared to go on those rides. Even I wouldn’t go on them, only my wife and one child would. My wife was infuriated by his comments but kept it to herself. Despite Zac stating we’d be done by 1430, and could then use our express passes to get through the rest of the rides, our tour didn’t finish until 1615, and we were never taken to the prop room.  Overall, my family and I LOVE Universal studios. It’s our favorite park in Orlando, and that is why we purchased the VIP experience for the park. Unfortunelty, we were extremely disappointed in our VIP experience. I read tons of reviews from people who did the VIP and loved it and their tour guide. People stated their guides took pictures of the their family, provided waters and ponchos. We had to ask for a poncho on the Jurassic Park River Adventure. He commented to the store worker, “their making me get them rain ponchos.” His tone made my wife feel guilty for asking for one. He never once offered to take a picture of our family or offered us water. After the park closed and we finished shopping at the stores, we attempted to go by the VIP office to discuss our visit, but they were already closed. Once, we returned home, we wrote the above review and emailed it to them. We got a preworded standard response that our experience would be forwarded to people higher up, and we'd be contacted. We never were. My wife called them 2 weeks later and was told someone would call her back. Again no response."
907,2019-3,"Lines were very long but rides never disappoint. Staff is amazing as always, but souvenirs are a bit expensive."
908,2019-3,"Got there early and rode several of the more popular rides without a wait. Layer waits of 20-30 minutes were average during a mid January weekday. Park was clean and shows with animals and make-up were more entertaining than the rides which all seemed similar with 3 D glasses and fast faux motion with chairs that changed direction with the scenery. Food was expensive, so be sure to bring a back pack with snacks and water bottles."
909,2019-3,There is something for everyone. The rides are amazing! More rides than island of adventure. Jimmy Fallon 3D is great. The mummy is one of our favorite and transformers. I highly recommend this park!
910,2019-3,AMAZING! Had Douglas as a guide and he was incredible. He knew so much about the park and was very attentive to our needs. Great ambassador for Universal. Had enough time to do two parks in one day and not feel rushed. Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure were amazing. Loved Hagrid's Motorbike ride. Great time of year to go not super crowded. Was our first visit and we all had a blast!
911,2019-3,We felt like we had stepped into that galaxy far far away. We were totally blown away with the detail that Disney had taken to make you feel like you were in Star Wars.
912,2019-3,"We have been here probably 10 times in the past 2 years and we love the place.  Always clean and the staff are hard working and friendly.  It has some fabulois rides...Harry Potter, The Mummy, Simpsons, Jimmy Fallon etc and some good shops.  I love coming here of a night as its cooler and the ambience is more relaxed, plus the queue times are often a lot smaller.  Love this place...its like a second home to me and my partner."
913,2019-3,"If in Orlando visiting Disney World, be sure to spend some time at Universal. The park has something for everybody. We were so impressed with the attractions! Will definitely go back!"
914,2019-3,"Any amount of time spent there is not enough. We did the Gringotts ride, MIB, Transformers, Mummy, Fast and Furious rides. The line ups were really long with Gringotts being 120 minutes. Be prepared to spend a lot of time in line ups with no food and water and bathroom break. The new thing from our last trip was that you had to check in your bags/ back packs. Carry standard size bags as the over sized ones don't fit in the lockers. It is USD 2 per locker. Smaller lockers are free. We could wait in the child swap section with the oversized backpack and swap for the rides. They could do with some more staff inside some rides as the line ups are snaky and winding and dark. Not ideal for claustrophobic people.Also some electronic signs to say how far into the time are you at that spot would also help."
915,2019-3,"If you like motion simulators this is the place for you. The Harry potter rides were the only thing I would ride more then once. I like real amusement rides, where the drops and spins are real. The coaster here was broken for most of the day I was there. They kept working on it, testing it, then opening the line, only to have it break down again, after 5 hours I was done with the place, and we had the park hopper where we could go back and forth...It is just too expensive and not enough diversity. I will never go back"
916,2019-3,"We split our visit between a Saturday and a Monday. On Saturday, Lyft dropped us off and we entered Universal Studios and went directly to Diagon Alley. It was crowded, but very fun. We rode Escape from Gringotts, exchanged money and rode the train to Hogwarts.The train was great! We skipped Hogwarts (visited Monday - see magical moment review) and went on everything we wanted. We enjoyed all attractions, with the exception of The Mummy. There are other areas that have space to just breath, rest and explore. Waits were minimal for attractions. We sat by the water at Duff's Brewery and then walked over to Moe's to just check it out. Over all a great day and we left before closing and returned on Monday."
917,2019-3,"Visited two nights for HHN29. First time visiting and have booked for HHN30. The place is amazing. Scareactors are professional. Houses are so good, especially Us. Stranger Things was amazing, we walked through at the perfect time! Can’t wait to come back!"
918,2019-3,"On Jan 15, visited the park with my family from Toronto.  It was kind of a unique experience with some of the simulation rides such as Harry Potter. Express entry pass helped us get easy access to most of the rides. I personally think it can be very tough for families with young kids to stand in such long line up in a cramped environment with not much shade around: so, better to get an easy access pass, when possible. Most of the rides required, locker service to keep your belongings prior to departure; therefore, it's better not to carry large back packs as they may not even fit in the locker( also costs you $3 for locker rental).  The chief issue with this place is the lack of enthusiasm in employees ( with few exceptions); most of them walked like a zombie and showed no interest in ""serving with a smile"" Among them, the worst of all were-Renatta and Dani(greeters at Harry Potter ride). When approached them to inquire about the wait time, replied mockingly ""read the board,says 120 mts"" When we replied with the feed back that a proper customer service also means a caring attitude, her friend Dani walked in to defend her and replied-- "" you got the information,now out"" They also shouted from behind, make sure you complaint at the guest service on your way out and had good laugh between them.Renata, also reminded not to forget that her name spells with 2Ts!! What an unprofessional team !!  My recommendation is-this is not a place for everyone. If you like simulation rides so much, willing to wait in long line up in a cramped place under the sun ( not many trees around), ready to put up with unfriendly staff, and able to pay $273 (including express pass), go for it!!  foot note: we had spent 4 happy days at Disneyworld prior to going to universal--I think, it was the friendly staff who made the experience more memorable at Disney).."
919,2019-3,"We did a one day off season visit. We only did one day as our focus was Harry Potter and we wanted our overall trip to be low key.  We did the park hopper which is surprisingly expensive compared to the park to park. However, it is needed for one day and I would recommend for multiple.  It was not crowded at all (Wednesday) and we arrived when the park opened. The only ride with a long line was the new Hagrid ride. All others had little to no waits. We easily did both Harry Potter parks in half a day and spent the rest in the other areas. Seeing everything would require two days.  We ate at the Leaky Cauldron which was cute. Food was very expensive.  The light show on the castle was the perfect end to the trip.  My biggest complaint was that the park closed at 7 PM. Way too early and limited what we were able to see."
920,2019-4,"This review is about park value...did we get the bang for our buck and could we have done better?  After finding $80 flights we set a budget of $1800 for four from Chicago - we were willing to spend more but not if we didn't have to.  The two parks (Studios and Islands) are right next to each other and connect (about 400 meters apart) via the front gates or via the Hogwarts Express on the backside. We never considered the water park as we have showers at home.  With tax we spent just under $1100 on park tickets and got four park to park tickets for three days. We stayed at a Universal hotel and got into the Universal Studios park an hour early. Here are some tips:  1. Park to Park. I would make this a priority. The Hogwarts Express was excellent but we also switched parks from the front a couple of times. You can definitely get tired of the Universal Studio rides in under a day and you could eliminate a wasted ""rain day"" on the Island side by having the indoor rides on the Studios side. Get the park to park.  2. Express Pass. Not necessarily worth it but under certain circumstances a great deal. First, Express Pass is currently not available for the best ride - Hagrid. Second, we only had 30+ minute wait times on a few rides. BUT we went OFF PEAK and SUNDAY through TUESDAY. A weekend or holiday travel might make a speed pass a necessity.  3. Days. We did two days and got a third day free. This was good but not amazing. Frankly, we were done after two days and went back the third day to reride Hagrid, Forbidden Forest and buy a wand with a gift card we had.  4. Extra Hour from Universal Hotels. Meh. Studios opens early but Islands doesn't open early. Additionally, almost nothing at Studios is open before 9 am. So, don't plan on being done with Harry Potter at 9:05 am just because you got in an hour early. The best thing it does is helps you avoid the opening gate lines which can be sizeable and exhausting.  5. Food. It's crap and it's expensive - you already knew that. We bought cereal and milk for breakfast, budgeted park food at $50/day, and figured we could eat at more conventional off site restaurants for dinner....and we still got ripped off.  Eating at the park sucked. Jurassic Park and Krustyburger food was below McDonald's quality - even before considering the expense. Hogsmeade food was significantly better but was limited in selection and more expensive.  But here's the crappy part. The entire zone around the parks is a tourist trap - Fisherman's Wharf, Soho London, Times Square -- all Orlando is overpriced. Not just the City Walk area --- we dropped $50 at iHop on the same meal(s) we get in Chicago for $25. Burgers at Applebees were $10-$18 and only slightly more edible than Krustyburger. It's all a money grab, just try not to feed the monster uncontrollably  If you have off-peak questions I think I can answer but with EPIC already being prebranded -- I'm not sure how long my answers will be relevant."
921,2019-4,"My wife and I love coming here for the attractions. They have great parades and shows along with one of my favorite rides, Rip Ride Rocket! The park is very clean with friendly and helpful staff. The rides are my favorite part though because I love the 4D aspect. I'm not even that much of a Simpsons fan but I love hanging out in that area of the park. I highly recommend coming here!"
922,2019-4,"The wife and I had one week of vacation. Decided to do the universal parks for two of our days. Worst mistake we have ever made. Four rides had breakdowns over the two day period. One, Gringotts broke down on at least three occasions on the same day. Paid for express pass, waited in line three times and were turned away each time on the 9th. Tried to purchase beverages on three different occasions and their computers were down. Rides are getting old, Simpsons ride, the door would not close on the ride. Very disappointed! Addressed customer service and were made to feel like liars. The gentleman said, [We have no record of those breakdowns]. And were turned away. And there were other issues with this gentleman. VERY BAD EXPERIENCE! These are the people who they put in customer service to deal with issues! Will never return!"
923,2019-4,"As a senior I feel that Universal Studios is worth going to once. I don’t feel the need for a return visit. The best part was the Harry Potter section-it’s worth it to buy the park to park ticket so you can ride the Hogwarts express. I also enjoyed Kong, Spider-Man and ET.  The light show in the Harry Potter section was very good. The parade during the day was OK but I enjoyed the parade at Disney world much more.  It was worth staying at a hotel on site because it was easy to use the water taxi and because we were given express pass tickets. With express passes, we spent very little time waiting in lines.  We did not go on roller coasters so I cannot comment on that other than to say that we heard the newest ride had a waiting list of six hours and that was at 9 AM!  Be sure to order the hot butter beer drink and have the butter beer ice cream - especially if you like butterscotch flavor.  Start at the back of the park and do the Harry Potter sections first, early in the day. It gets too crowded in the afternoon. Do the other sections of the park in the afternoon"
924,2019-4,Love Universal. Great rides we chose Universal over Disney so we could do the new Hagrid Motorcycle Ride. We figured we don't have any little kids so Disney wouldn't be too much fun and we aren't really big Star Wars Fans.
925,2019-4,"Amazing! My husband and I really enjoyed all the attractions because most of them are in 3D or 4D very nice! I love going there in winter because the weather is amazing. February is a good month to go, I could repeat a lot of rides and we didn’t have fast pass at all."
926,2019-4,180.00 each to get in. Would never go again. Too many other things to do around orlando. Pay 750.00 to wait in lines for 2 hours and so many rude people I couldn't believe it.
927,2019-4,"Some of my favourite rides are in this park could easily spend my whole holiday here, it's a must if your in florida"
928,2019-4,My family and I had a great 3 days at Universal. The rides were great and the lines were minimal. Harry potter world was beyond incredible!
929,2019-4,"We visited Universal Studios Jan 8th-11th, 2020. It was relatively quiet when we visited and we had short wait lines. In general compared to Islands of Adventure, the wait times were shorter at Universal Studios. The Mummy was our favourite ride. The Rip Rockin Rollercoaster- I found it very hard on the head as it was shaky. I will not ride it again although my partner went on it a second time. The Escape from Gringotts ride was pretty good. Be sure to check out the Universal App. The free lockers for individual rides were very easy to use, just scan your park ticket. Some of the locker areas were very crowded though based in layout. The Harry Potter area is very busy."
930,2019-4,"Only the Harry Potter Part was convincing, for all other attractions we had to wait almost ages to do them, the waiting times varied between 1 and 4 hours for one attraction, thats definitely too long, finally i was very disappointed, fazit: not recommandable"
931,2019-4,An absolute must for anyone visiting LA. It was amazing to see all those magical sets and rides. The guides were tremendous and very knowledgeable. It was fun being a part of the tv show Friends even though the real characters were absent.
932,2019-4,Great parks some areas could you a refresh for sure. I would expect a park that is in competition with disney to be on the same level. I think I saw while I was there maybe 6 employees be polite and smiling the rest seemed like zombies and they were just there to be there. Will I return sure everyone deserves a second chance .
933,2019-4,"Universal Studios provides fun for all ages. Excellently organised from parking to security screening, access is swift and pleasant. All staff are courteous and helpful adding to the overall positive and upbeat atmosphere at Universal. There are plenty of amazing places to eat (book ahead) with a variety of eating experiences. Our favourite was Vivo Italian Kitchen or Bubba Gumps. Both serving great food, reasonably priced. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is our favourite place with our two favourite rides. Escape from Gringotts is brilliant, Hagrids Magical Creatures Motorbike cannot be missed and The Forbidden Journey is my all time favourite. The detail of design in every ride and building is incredible. Choosing your wand at Ollivanders is something you will always remember, 55 euro will buy you an interactive wand that can be used through The Wizarding World of Harry Potter with lots of interesting spells to be cast by your own hand. This was our third visit to Universal and ai doubt it will be our last. A wonderful holiday for adults and children. It is expensive and fast pass adds a lot of extra expense however I would only buy them at peak times, short wait times are totally possible at low volume dates. Staying at some Universal Hotels offer fast pass as part of your package and are worth considering. If you are staying outside the park, Parking is 40 euro a day so booking a hotel with a shuttle bus is a great saving. Universal is magical with so much to do. An excellent holiday."
934,2019-4,"I took my 5 year old daughter to Disney and my 10 year old son here. This is for the older kids for sure. He went to Disney when he was 6 and thought it was OK. He loves roller coasters and thrill rides so Universal was such a better option for him.  We opened and closed the park. We started at Universal in the morning, right at opening. I bought the Fast Passes for Islands of Adventure for 4 pm and later. You can do both parks in one day and if I had to pick a park, IOA has the better coasters and thrill rides. We were able to get right in to a lot of rides by going early. If I hadn’t have gone during Christmas break, I don’t think I would have needed a fast pass at all. It’s very expensive during busy times. $100/ticket for fast passes after 4pm and that’s the reason for my 4 and not 5 star rating. Prices have just gone up so drastically the last few years.  Universal has mostly 3D/4D simulations and mild thrill rides. Perfect for younger children and still fun due to the movie/show themes. We go to Cedar Point in Ohio and the coasters there are super tall, fast and scary compared to Universal. I enjoy both types of parks. My son had a blast and got brave enough to ride the Hulk at IOA towards the end. Definitely a wonderful memory for us both!"
935,2019-4,Crowded beyond belief..prices has gone sky high. Tickets and food was 1500$ for a day of parkwalking in Line.
936,2019-4,Been 10 years since i last went and just short of 20 since mum last went!!safe to say massive floride blues going off right now!! Anyone ever gets the chance to go....take it! You wont regret it especially at Universal fun for all no matter how old or how many times you've been on rides previously!
937,2019-4,"Love this park, great for young and old. So much to see and do. Grinchmas best show ever. Meeting the Grinch wow wow. All the superheroes great. Staff here was really helpful with our son in wheelchair made sure he got to meet his favourite superhero’s thank you so much. Harry Potter everything is great although gets very packed, wish the shops was bigger because you can’t get in them with a big wheelchair. Only let down is the food places, seems more expensive than Disney and on busy days take ages to queue for food. We was there Thanksgiving week and queued for 40 minutes for food this was after walking around for few to find anywhere with seating."
938,2019-4,"It’s just an absolutely amazing place to be and see the kids excitement and disbelief at everything that’s going on. The rides are excellent, Harry Potter ones are something else, it is busy, you need fast passes to make the day enjoyable. We had a day of going around slowly and getting all the photo opportunities and videos to remember the place. Then had two days with fast passes and just did everything on offer. Really couldn’t bare some of the queues, anything from 45 to 2 and a half hours. Something to think about. Especially if it’s hot. Would be horrible without them I think. Also be there when it’s dark the place just seems like another world."
939,2019-4,"Great theme park. We’ve been many times over the years. Buy the fast pass, it’s definitely worth it. Otherwise, you’ll spend most of your day waiting in line instead of riding the rides. Cheap it’s not, but candidly I wouldn’t do it without & I’m a season ticket holder."
940,2019-4,"I have to say I love Universal better than Disney. I think now my son is a teenager, this park is more suited to us. It was quite busy some days but others we were walking on the rides and managed to go the whole park twice. Spiderman was always my favourite but Transformers and Kong have sneaked ahead. We had the refillable drink which was a god send some days but the queuing for a refill could quite often get frustrating, especially when there's 1 member of staff run off their feet."
941,2019-5,"Leaving from our 5 night stay at Universal Studios. What a wonderful trip and I definitely had more fun and enjoyment than my girls. We went with a family of four. Myself, husband and two girls Ages 19 and 13. We went for My daughters 13th birthday. I will give you the tips I learned from this trip. 1). Definitely stay at a Universal hotel. Staying in one that includes express pass is the only way to go in my opinion. The Parks are a short walk or boat ride away. Boats run every 10 mins or so until Past midnight. So convenient! 2). To me it would be a big waste of money to come to these parks without express pass. Whether you stay in hotel which includes them or buy them yourself, although ridiculously expensive, it’s the only way to see everything and enjoy yourself with little stress. We literally walked right on 80% of the rides and the ones we waited for was maybe 15 mins at the most. 3). The new Harry Potter motorcycle ride does not take express pass but worth the wait. So cool! 4). Wait to go on the Harry Potter rides a few hours after opening. The lines become a little shorter. 5). Harry Potter area in both parks is always packed with people no matter what time. We rode all the rides for Harry Potter multiple times but then left the area as way too crowded. The rest of the park was not too crowded. 6). We went to the new Harry Potter ride right at opening and there was a 120min wait due to all the people who enter Universal at early 8 am access(another perk to staying in a Universal hotel) take the HP train (very neat) over to Island of Adventure and get on line for the ride. Island of Adventure opens at 9 (no early access there this time of year) and everyone heads right to HP. 7). The wait times for rides that are listed are never that long! The 120min HP wait took us less than an hour and the last 20 mins was inside which is so cool to see and look at that it doesn’t seem like your waiting in “line” and it moves quick. The other HP rides all except express Pass and we rode them all multiple times. Escape from Gringotts is one of the best! 8) Express pass is always faster than single rider line if you have it. If not it’s a good option as well as child swap. 9). Ride the Hulk roller coaster. It’s the BEST!! 10). Enter park early and see Despicable Me. The line gets long quick! 11). I still love E.T. And miss Jaws! 12). Did I mention how express pass is a Must!! 13.) buy an “all day refill cup”. You do have to add $ to it each additional day but you can refill as many times as you want. Best is to buy one and all the stands will refill with cold ice water for all the days there. 14). The only negative thing I can say is that everything is so expensive! Admission. Express pass and the food and drink is really too expensive."
942,2019-5,We did 16 rides in one day on New Year’s Eve with the express pass. While the express pass is very $$$ but was so worth it. Cant wait to make a trip back to the area again
943,2019-5,"When we plan a trip to Disney world, we usually set aside a day for Universal. But many things disappointed me this time and I wanted to post this review to have people consider if they really want to spend the money for a day there. At least so your homework. 1) First if all - if you want to see all of Happy Potter - you will need to pay to get into 2 parks. We payed $185.31 ($174+tax) for a 2 Park one day ticket per person. It costs more if you buy at the ticket booth in the park. I used a mobile delivery and had the ticket delivered to my smartphone. That’s a lot of money for a family of 4.  2) This time of year - the park is only open until 7pm. A lot of ground to cover for 2 parks and considering how much you are paying g for a ticket. 3) So you would expect the rides to be in good working condition. Especially the widely popular Harry Potter section. When we got there, the 2 rides in IOA: the new Hagrid’s Motorbike ride was closed. Harry Potter and the forbidden journey was experiencing delays. So we headed to The Eacape from Gringots ride at Universal. Wait was posted as 55 minutes. The line went slowly. We wished we had our backpack with some drink and snacks - but we had to put it in a locker ! We got to near of the end of the line after waiting in the queue for more than a 90 minutes and they “flushed the queue” due to technical difficulties! They did give us a FP on the way out - but it didn’t seem to cover the time lost (I could have went on 3 Other rides), sore feet and back from waiting in line that long (hey that’s messing with my Health and ability to do other things as a result of pain); needless to say - everyone was very upset. Not to mention that the People in line flooded the streets and now everything else was impossible to get into. Even Hogwarts express train - wasn’t an express and had a 55 minute wait. So we quickly Rushed to the Leaky Cauldron - which had really filled up. We were able to get some good food and rest a while. My Cottage pie came with a salad and was very good. We also got the bangers and mash - and my so. And his GF enjoyed those. Hubby got the fish pie and enjoyed that. We also got a kids Mac and cheese with a side of grapes and applesauce which also was good. They do seat you - maybe because it was busy. But we ended up getting a seat against the wall that was quiet. After we were done - we checked the time for Hogwarts Express - and it was still long ! So we headed to the front of the park where we could use the Front entrance to switch to the other park (IOA) since the Hogwarts Express lube was too long.. Disappointing. I used the opportunity to visit with guest relations.  4) Guest relations and what they can do: I’ll start out by saying the young woman who assisted us was very nice. However, the best she could do was offer us each another FP. I would have preferred a partial refund or another FP. I also brought up the fact that we had to pay for a locker for the ride - she didn’t bring it up on her own. Practically had to beg to get the $2 back. But She did give us $2 cash.  5) which brings me to the lockers. Most of the thrill rides have the lockers. It’s a pain and time consuming to get your stuff in and out. It requires the code from your ticket - but the code doesn’t work from a smartphone and you need to get a paper one from an attendant in the area. On top of that - If you need a Large locker - you need to pay $2 for it. We had a large backpack -So we had to pay it. They don’t take cash. You need a credit card. And you need to spend this $2 for each ride !!! What a way to make even more money after robbing you the cost of your ticket !  6) we finally got into IOA thru the front entrance. We bypassed the Incredible Hulk and the Spider-Man ride so we could get to the back of the park to check out the Wizarding world of Harry Potter before it was dark. On the way - we also noticed the King Kong ride was partially outside. So after taking some pics in Harry Potter world I’m the daylight - we back-tracked to the Skull Island King Kong ride instead of using a FP to ride Harry Potter and the forbidden journey. Since the line was long and the ride is inside, we figured we could come back. We waited a little while in the FP King Kong line - and it was very cool - albeit a bit shorter than I expected.  7) the Hagrid motorbike line was over 100 minutes and had closed on and off thru the day, so...  8) we went back to Harry Potter to find the Forbidden Journey ride closed !! It was 6pm and they were closing in an hour and we had not ridden any Harry Potter rides! We made a bee-line for the Howard’s express - but we first had to wait in line to go thru the ticket line to go to the other land in Universal. After waiting for 10 minutes in the ticket line we the. Went to wait in the Hogwarts express line. I checked the wait times one more time to see if Escape from Gringots might have reopened - holding out little hope - since it was closed most of the day after our wait. Miraculously it was open with a 25 minute wait. We made a bee-line to it after our Hogwarts express ride. We barely made it Into line at 6:58. And after waiting the allotted time - we finely were able to ride the ride! So we didn’t go home totally disappointed.  8) on a positive note - after we were done the ride - we wandered around a mostly deserted Diagon Alley. We also finally saw the dragon breath fire. The dragon didn’t breathe fire thru the day. Which is another negative. I believe the dragon breathed fire all thru the day when we were there last 5 years ago.  Thru the day we also managed to go on the Mummy, MIB and the Simpsons.  That’s 7 rides in 8.5 hours. That’s $26.47 a ride. I guess you have to also account for lunch and ambiance... but still... I can understand that the new Hagrid ride might be done because it’s new - but the other 2 have been around for over 5 years ! They shouldn’t be down. If they need maintenance - please do the maintenance in the Off-hours when no one is in the park. Also note that I read that one of the Harry Potter rides will be down for maintenance Jam 16-17 - so consider that if you plan to go on either of those days.  9) did i mention that you can save some time and get FPs for all the rides by staying on property ($$) or buying a FP ticket for all the rides for a mere $96 on top of what you’re paying already... thanks Universal ...  10) we won’t be going back any time soon. The old rides we’ve done and we’ll wait for the Harry Potter rides to be fixed or for the popularity to wean... if you really need to go - I recommend you do your homework. Download the “Universal wait times” app and monitor it a few days prior to going... check and see thru the day if the rides remain up. And buy your tickets online a day or so before you plan to go when you know the weather will be good and the rides are running. You can use the ticket they send you to your email from your phone.  Good luck !  ... And I hope to see some better ticket discounts and or longer hours from Universal for their customers. Otherwise I believe they are just thinking of making the most $$ for themselves."
944,2019-5,We only had one day so we paid extra for fast passes. We had such a great day. The highlight was all the Harry Potter rides & worlds but the Jurassic Park ride was fantastic too. Greatly recommended
945,2019-5,"We came down to visit the Harry Potter experience but wanted to enjoy the rest of the park as well. My biggest issue with the park is that some of the rides won’t accommodate larger riders. That was a huge bummer after spending the amount of money we did to come down to visit. The attention to detail everywhere in the park is impressive. My husband thoroughly enjoyed the Incredible Hulk coaster. He bought a Spider-Man onesie, and we both really liked the marvel comic book area. The Spider-Man ride was super cute. The mummy was lots of fun. I was really excited for the men in Black ride (I remember it from years ago), but it seemed lackluster compared to the newer rides. The minion ride was cute, and the videos made the wait time not seem so bad. The shrek experience apparently needs new glasses. Everything just looks blurry not 3D. The wait times were a little high for this being the off season. The carousel was neat. The cat in the hat was ok. We ate at the Confisco Grille which was excellent. We had ice cream at the parlor in Diagon Alley, and it was tasty but it would’ve been nice to be able to sample it first. The shop keepers were all fabulous. Fast and the Furious was fun. The transformers ride was fun. We were able to do way more in the same amount of time than we were able to at Disney. The people mover made it much easier to gain access. Going between the two parks was fairly easy until the train had a 70 minute wait. It would be nice to have another way to get between the two parks without having to walk all the way around and re-enter. Security was easy. Guest services were friendly."
946,2019-5,"Family of five, with mix of teen, almost teen and young child. It was during Christmas week. Excellent experience especially after we visited Disney 3 times before and on the same week we visited 2 parks at Disney and it was terrible compared to Universal. Our only negative comment was the pricing of the fast pass (express pass) was overpriced. Otherwise it was a beautiful experience."
947,2019-5,"This was our first ever visit to florida. We had the best time ever and are already planning our next trip in November 2020. You must visit chocolate emporium, you will be amazed."
948,2019-5,"We knew going into the visit the park would be at peak numbers if guest. We still had a day to go and scout out both islands of adventure and universal studios to see if we would want to include them in future Orlando vacations. 1. The rides are very impressive however, very hard to get onto due to the insane wait times. 2. Unlike other parks in the area I feel like at universal their only real options are rides,food, and shopping. They do not offer many shows or other entertainment options that would greatly help reduce the wait times and make the park flow better. 3. We went with our 16yr old and 4yr old. Unless they start offering more shows and Maybee even more rides and attractions to help reduce wait times we will not go back. 4. To be able to meet some of the characters you have to go in the ride first and at the end meet the characters. When the wait for the ride says 120min + not a good choice. 5. They need to be as honest as possible and not out 120min+ and be more accurate with the actual real wait times"
949,2019-5,"We came for Disney, had 2 days spare so tried universal, as the kids wanted more scarier rides. Had fast passes so didn’t wait for anything, thought all the scenery was great, Harry Potter section was really good. Got lucky with minimal crowds. The Gringot ride broke down when we were on it, but we got to go on it again (although sent around the employee section to get back on, so the ‘magic’ was lost there. Really should of just let us stay in the car and go again). The down side to it being more exciting for teenagers and up, is there are obnoxious teenagers and up there. Had a group of 9 push in front of us halfway in the waitline for the mummy- started with 3, then all their friends pushed through and joined them. Lots of 3D and 4d rides, not sure if it’s just me but they feel like the cheaters way out of making a ride, and my eyes were sore by the end of the day. caught an Uber there and back from Disney resort- cost around $20."
950,2019-5,"I've visited Universal Orlando numerous times in the past 20 years and always enjoyed it. Now as a mom of a 4 year old, I have to say experiencing the park with him was a whole new awesome experience. Now I will disclaim that aside from Dr. Seuss, Camp Jurassic and the Super Hero encounter, other than a lot of site seeing, there may not be many rides you can take a 4 year old on, but to explore the park and to see it bring to life movies and shows you've both seen there is still so much to enjoy. Camp Jurassic for us was were it was at though! Free exploration, cave, caverns, glowing amber caverns, waterfalls that run through the caves, bridges, the echo cavern... it goes on! It really is such a splendid place for kids to explore. Parents just be ready to the physical requirements! There a lot of climbing, stairs, net climbs and if you have a little one that is as excited as ours was to explore everything, the right shoes are a must :) but be ready for the joy in adventure without the lines for a while. What a great place for the kids! So in 2019 was the first time we visited as a family, and thanks to military discounted tickets we were able to go back 4 more times for a great price! the park to park ticket is a must! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, I don't know why they still sell the single park ticket. Harry Potter is beautiful! The design, the details, the characters, the fire breathing dragon, and all the special interactive things for wizards with the interactive wand can do! What a blast! UO can literally make a third park strictly Harry Potter and it would be amazing! Super Hero Island is great for my kiddo; HOWEVER, what a bummer they can't really expand and bring more of the recent MCU... I say this because my son WAS the biggest Thor fan and we could not find much Thor merchandise unless we wanted to fork our $$$ for the collectors statues (which we already have). A HUGE thank you to the Dr. Doom and Green Goblin characters! On our first visit, my son was dressed in his Thor hammer shirt and brought his hammer with him, what a blast how Green Goblin and Dr. Doom played out a scene, failing to lift the hammer for they were not worthy! What a blast, what a memorable experience. Jurassic Park exploratory is a nice place for the young dino enthusiast! We love going there when its a bit quieter to explore on the interactive activities and dinos, and the learn that the skeletons on display were the actual props from Jurassic Park! Thank you to the specialists there who let us in on that bit of information! The dining past over the years has really tightened up where it's not much of a deal for families. It's advised you eat a good breakfast, and perhaps consider exploring the good food options just a walking distance away in City Walk! Take a look, so many options for a decent print (theme park price) but more options, and better quality that some of the options in the mean deal. So much to say, you'll love the park. Do you research and see how other families/locals save some money and truly get the most out of their experience. Also, the UO phone app is WONDERFUL! You can store your ticket info. makes it easy to present and great in the event you misplace your physical ticket temporarily. You can check the status of rides, wait times, times for events all at the convenience of your phone. It's a very well done app."
951,2019-5,"I went with friends to Universal Studios, primarily to ride the new Hagrid's roller coaster. The first day, the app said the line was 2 hours long, and we arrived four hours before the Park closed -- they had already closed the line for the day. The second day, the app said the line was 9O minutes long, and we arrived five hours before the park closed, and once again they had closed the line for the day already. The third day, at noon they had signs out saying the ride had already met capacity, but a line agent said there were technical problems (despite what the signs said).  Given all of the advertising about the new coaster, you would think that any company that had any commitment to customer service would go the extra mile to make sure that as many guests as possible ride the ride. Given that Universal is owned by Comcast, it seems that the infection for zero customer service is catching......  I also wrote to the park directly and got an amazingly lame response. They basically acknowledged that they don't ever want to pay employees to have to stay keeping the ride open until the line went down after park closing. The way they're doing it, employees are probably even getting off early!  Universal Orlando, where the customer experience is well down the list of priorities......"
952,2019-5,"Went to Universal on 27 Dec. We were very exited to see the Harry Potter side of the parks. Arrived at 7.30 and managed to enter by 8.00. Had a park to park ticket with express passes for both parks. During the day, especially at Island of Adventures it was literally not possible to walk due to the numbers of people the park allowed to enter. Despite the numbers, the park continued to sell express passes. There do not seem to be a restricted number of passes and anyone who is willing to pay may get one. As Island of Adventures had 3 HP rides it was even more crowded than US. It was not possible to even walk through the Hogsmeade village. There were a queue at the butterbeer stand that snaked through the entire park and with the queues for the rides it was literally gridlocked. Never ever ever go to Universal in December. It is a sure and solid waste of money. Some of the other rides faired a little better. We were 12 people in our group and simply gave up around 6 pm and left the park. A very expensive mistake. If you are of a body type that is the larger side please be aware that you will not fit into some of the rides. Don't waste money on an express pass and then not be allowed to ride. The other serious ripoff is the backpack storage. They have free lockers for a very small bag. Anything bigger cost $2 for every ride. We spent another $40 on bag storage. First you queue to store tha bag and then to do the ride. All in all not worth it. Go on the most unpopular day of the year if you want to enjoy it."
953,2019-5,"There were unfortunate staff errors and a bit of a run-around with our tickets upon arrival, but a really great employee ""fixer"" got us all squared away and even comped me a Universal hoodie for our trouble. I wish I remembered her name, but she was the BEST.  The price for an Express Pass is exorbitant, but on this crowded day I'd estimate that we were able to enjoy at least 2-3 times as many attractions as we would have without it. The standard wait times were terrible at many attractions, and I don't come to parks like this to stand in line all day. Bottom line, the pass let us enjoy our day rather than being constantly frustrated.  Price gauging is rampant at all the Orlando parks, and Universal is no exception - two simple veggie burgers with fries and sodas at Mel's Diner set us back almost 40 bucks. That's ridiculous, and the Universal execs should be ashamed of themselves.  Employees were generally very nice, with the notable exception of a french braid sporting sour-faced girl at the Harry Potter locker area - this unhappy soul was just as rude as she was dull, angry, and incompetent. This type of employee needs to be scrubbing bathrooms after hours, not interacting with customers.  But the new coaster, Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, was innovative, packed with fun surprises, and easily the best thing I rode all day. It's a can't-miss, to be sure."
954,2019-5,"Very easy. And if you follow the directions, even easier. I’ve already recommended this to a friend."
955,2019-5,"This is the place where they want you to wait in line. When the line is shorter so you can get the attraction before the marked wait time then they announce a break. My kids were very disappointed that they asked to leave the place. In addition, it is expensive and really laud."
956,2019-5,"Visited with family in December rides are amazing but staff are rude and so unpleasant! If you deciding between parks then Disney is a better option for value and respect of guests and cleanliness. The Restaurants are dirty and we were told if we want a clean table to wipe it down ourselves. We went to both universal and Island is adventure, we were rudely told what line to be in, the staff have no clue where rides are or what time characters appear and there is no schedule and if there is one they don’t stick to it. When you complain to guest services all they say is “sorry” Universal has a lot to learn from Disney Parks!!!"
957,2019-5,"We went to Universal Studios Theme Park in November. It was a good time of year to go there, warm but not too hot and cool in the evenings. Although it was warm in the day, as soon as the sun went down it got pretty cool. The first day I was there I had to buy a hoodie. We discovered that we could get on the rides as quickly as the people that bought the fast pass if we went into the single rider lines. Many of the rides you can't really converse with your friends on the rides anyway and it made the time waiting a lot less. The down side of this is that in some cases you miss part of the experience. For instance in the Harry Potter Castle there is a lot to see as you wind through the line. The singles line bypasses many parts. For me the sacrifice was worth the time savings!"
958,2019-5,Pizza prices inside Universal Studios was $30 per pizza which is outrageous on a holiday when so much crowd depend on inside the studios food. Many rides were shown false wait times where as in actual they were able to be done in half the time posted in the app. Management to please be fair with the Customers on pricing and true with wait times.
959,2019-5,"Again, this park does not disappoint. Always lots going on, fun rides and so much to see. Don’t know how anyone can’t like it. When there in September most rides were walk ons or a very short wait & finally got to try the large donut and a flaming mo 🔥"
960,2019-5,"Spent the day exploring Universal Studios as well as Islands of Adventure to experience all the Harry Potter settings and rides. Hagrid's Magical Creatures motorbike tour was an awesome rollercoaster ride, the Forbidden Journey is an excellent simulator ride (as long as you don't get motion sickness). Over the 2 parks these were my top 3: . The Hulk . Hagrid's Magical Creatures motorbike . The Rip Tide Rockit Staying at the Hard Rock hotel enabled us to get in earlier, worth the price."
961,2019-5,Going from one park to the other aboard the Hogwartz train is a must! I love both Universal and Islands of Adventure. Both parks have something for everyone.
962,2019-6,"It is certain that you will enjoy the magic and amusement of the attractions, 3D, 4D, rides and the embellishment of magical worlds will delight the whole family, however, be prepared to spend a lot of cash $$$, these attractions are certainly expensive. Parking, entrances, and overpriced souvenirs and meals. Also Christmas and New Year is so overcrowded that you should mentally prepare for long lines of several hours to experience few minutes on the greatest attractions, or pay for express tickets or ride solo where possible. The park is well suited for the whole family and teens. You will probably walk a lot, stay standing in lines a lot, and get significantly tired. Multiday, muliti park tickets if you go to experience it several days will certainly help."
963,2019-6,"The only way I thought to maximise 1 full day at the two parks in Dec was to go for a VIP Experience! Was this worth it ? Totally in my opinion, I kept it a surprise for my daughter and it did not disappoint. We could do 13 rides with no ques, better than fast pass, behind the scenes access and breakfast and lunch included. The Vip experience for 2 adults was about $900 you need to purchase separate park tickets which were $373 through another site on Facebook that does price comparisons... Caught lyfts there and back about $26 each way ... with our guide Sara We caught the Hogwarts express The rides we did : Harry Potter and the forbidden journey wait time would have been 175mins Flight on the hippogriff Skull island Hulk coaster Adventures of 🕷 man Lunch from 12:30 till 13:15 at cafe la bamba Despicable me minion mayhem Hollywood rip rider rock it Transformers Race through New York Jimmy Fallon Revenge of the mummy Simpson’s ride And men in black Harry Potter escape from gringotts ￼ Unfortunately Hagrids motorcycle 🏍 was down .. A really great experience! Express passes after and 10% discount on merch"
964,2019-6,"Only spent time in Universal and Islands of Adventure. Too cold for Volcano Bay. Great parks. Many roller coaster rides and other attractions but frequent (glitches)/breakdowns, which are badly managed. Was stuck on Gringotts ride for 45 mins, was given a bump to front of queue pass which was a complete waste, as it is not valid on most rides and I was still pushed into the normal queue. Only managed to get on Hagrid’s ride once due to breakdowns and queue lengths. Even the single rider lane is busy as family groups use it which should be not allowed. Lots of walking to be done and distances can be tiring but plenty of places to stop, sit, eat or drink. Enjoyed ourselves very much. Highly recommend a FAST PASS. It really does save time queuing."
965,2019-6,"Realy nice ""town"" from the Harry Potter-movies! Great Service and personal working there and we will not forget!"
966,2019-6,"Park not overly crowed, most wait time approx 30/45 mins in Dec 19/ Jan 20 apart from the new Harry Potter ride which was 255 minutes but very worth it! This ride is outstanding it will leave you wanting more. The only negative thing is its the only ride that doesn’t accept express pass so just normal line only. Free parking after 6pm, we turned up one afternoon at 17:10 and the man didn’t charge us which i thought was good of him. We stuck to Disney for years with the kids being smaller but now there all for Universal, could do with a few smaller roller coasters as the minimum heights for the big ones are either 48 or 54 inches the youngest is 47 3/4 so depends on who’s on the measurements some let her on some don’t. Still a excellent place for them and highly recommend it. Harry Potter attractions either if your a fan or not os amazing."
967,2019-6,enjoyable experience being a kid again; luckily for us no long wait times so no fast pass needed; longest waits were for harry potter castle b/c it was new at that time; pretty long wait to ride train though
968,2019-6,"As a Floridian we are annual pass holders simply because there is no better place in Orlando to have a great day. The one caveat to that is the lines. They are everywhere. If you can afford the express pass, get one, otherwise just be very patient. It's great fun, but yes, every ride only lasts a few minutes and you can wait for an hour or more, in some places. Halloween and Christmas time is our favorite."
969,2019-6,"Our family decided to visit this park on Monday December 23 2019. I had previously read about long wait times during Christmas but we were very lucky and wait times were reasonable. We have visited this park 3 other times before but never in December. The park has alot to offer but on this visit the employees seemed miserable. They complained about working there and acted like the job was an inconvenience to them. I will not go back to universal studios until I have grandkids some day. The park was clean. The rides were good but ET is a bit run down. The refillable cup was good and negative. If you buy a refillable cup you dont wanna throw it in the trash to get on a ride so you have to put it in a locker. If you accidentally forget about your stuff in the locker and go back later to get it well you get charged , so make sure you have a game plan for every small detail. You can take snacks and a back pack in which is nice but it's more to keep up with. Food is high but its an amusement park so its expected. Parking is 26 dollars so preplanning for a trip there is very smart. Preplanning every thing including the times you visit the most popular rides."
970,2019-6,We just finished our last day at Universal and it was the best week with the family! We had so much fun and we have so many team member to thank!! We went on Men in Black and Sarah was nice and friendly! My daughter loved Men in Black the most and even getting the highest rank! Very cool! My wife and kids volunteered me to do Fear Factor and that was a blast!! I unfortunately didn't win but the cast and crew made it a great time! Gabby was very sweet and funny when she was getting my helmet on me and the guys in all black keeping me safe did an amazing job making it fun! Chase was funny and serious about the safety made it great! We ate dinner at Big Fire and it was a great way to end the trip. Thank you Universal and your employees for making it a great week!
971,2019-6,We had lots of fun but the express pass lines were huge. They should limit the amount sold because it was still a wait and line seemed longer at some rides. But still a great experience
972,2019-6,We all loved it.. Great rides (MUCH better than almost every Disney ride) and better queues.. Even better with express passes.
973,2019-6,"My family and I visited Universal in late December for two days. We purchased two day park to park with unlimited express pass. Although, the park was crowded we never waited for more than 20 mins for any ride. Since we purchased the unlimited express, we rode all our favs multiple times! It was fantastic because our items could stay in the lockers while we repeatedly rode our favs! This was definitely money well spent! Why doesn’t wdw offer this?My family and I had a blast and created more memorable family moments! We will definitely return!"
974,2019-6,"We have visited Universal many times of the past 10 years, and sadly they have never been the best experience. Nothing to do with the park itself, but I have a daughter with mental illness and it becomes overwhelming for her and for us. This visit thanks to amazing customer service, my daughter had the best time ever almost without an episode, which was when we knew it’s time to leave - not after half hour as per usual visits BUT 4 and half hours! Can’t thank Universal and staff enough!"
975,2019-6,Located in Islands of Adventures its a roller coaster that gave Harry Potter's groundkeeper his due. Its the Hogsmeade section of the park.
976,2019-6,Very expensive over the new year and the queues ere pretty bad but amazing experience. The rides are out of this world. Unfortunately did not get on the new Harry Potter ride as there was a 5 hour queue!
977,2019-6,With limited time available we decided to splurge and do the two park VIP experience. We were in a small group of 7 worth 3 teens. Luckily we got the brilliant Logan as a guide. The whole experience from start to finish was fabulous - we felt totally like VIPS walking straight into rides and going through all the secret entrances. Logan’s knowledge is outstanding and he tailored the day to everyone! We did 12 rides during the day and never felt rushed and wholeheartedly recommend the VIP experience - it will make standing in lines at other parks very tedious!
978,2019-6,Be aware that you have to put your stuff in lockers. Some lockers you have to pay and some you don’t. They need to have the same type of lockers for each ride because you get confused on what to do with putting your stuff in the lockers.
979,2019-6,"We visited Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure with a Park to Park pass on December 23. We stayed on site at Loews Royal Pacific in order to take advantage of the included express passes. This was a must for the holiday week! We were able to walk to the park for early admission, then bypass lines of 60-90 minutes and get to all the attractions we were hoping to do in both parks. We started with Diagon Alley. (True to the books, it's not well advertised. You have to search for it!) This area is really well done, and the Gringotts dragon is amazing! Our family is not a fan of roller coasters, but the Gringotts ride was fine. There is a gradual drop at the beginning, but nothing too fast or steep. Be aware you need to store your bags in a locker before riding; the process was pretty easy. We took the Hogwarts Express to the Islands of Adventure. The ride itself wasn't super exciting, but the setting of the train station and watching the Hogwarts Express pull up to platform 9 3/4 was fun. Be prepared to show your park-to-park ticket before boarding the train. Aside from the Wizarding World, we tried out a number of the simulator rides. Avoid the Simpsons ride if you are prone to motion sickness. Despicable Me has stationary seats in the front for people who prefer that. When you need a break from the rides, the Horror Make Up Show is a lot of fun! Wear your walking shoes, and don't let rain scare you away, as many of the lines and attractions are indoors."
980,2019-6,We visited Universal Studios over the new year holidays and had a blast! We did a two park for three days ticket and explored every corner of Universal Studios and Island of Adventure. The parks are wonderful and full of things to see and do.
981,2019-6,Took my wife and 2 sons (ages 13 and 15) here on vacation. These were the perfect ages for my kids. We really had a great time. The park itself looks like a city and really makes you feel like you’re walking down the streets in New York and Beverly Hills. The new Harry Potter section is also ridiculously realistic and makes you feel like you’re in the movie. Most of the rides are 3D Simulation rides and are incredibly real looking. This was an expensive vacation but ended up being one of the most fun family vacations that we’ve had. I highly recommend this park.
982,2019-6,"Went at Christmas time (27th Dec) and it was so busy and the prices were eyewatering and you pay more on top of this to park. Dont go in the holidays is my very strong recommendation. For a party of 6 with 1 day in 1 park with fast passes was £2500. Without the fast pass it would have been 4 hour waits for each ride. The ride experience was very good for Transformers, Gringotts and had fun on MIB ride; even for fast passes the waits were 1 hour....... It was a one off experience and I wouldnt go again"
983,2019-7,We toyed with the idea of a VIP experience or Express passes for Universal Studios and decided on Express. I’m glad we did this as there wasn’t anywhere near as much to do here as Island of adventure. They were well worth having as went straight to the front of the queues as it wasn’t hugely busy. I personally really enjoyed the rides here although a bit samey. Kids enjoyed it less and was more interested in the churros but had a lovely leisurely day all the same.
984,2019-7,"This is a great place to visit - from Marvel to Harry Potter - Dr Suess to The Simpsons, something for everybody here! Plenty to see and do - we stay in a Universal Hotel for one night, that gives you 2 days unlimited fast passes, which is cheaper than buying them and I wouldn't do the park without fast passes. You must ride Hagrid's Motorbike ride - out of this world!"
985,2019-7,"Had a great time, but the one day, two park ticket price has just got out of control. $209.00 per person is just to high!! For 11 people it was more than my home monthly mortgage."
986,2019-7,"Really enjoyed the continual improvements they’ve put into USF. The synergy between universal and nbc brands really creates some fun new experiences like Tonight Show ride and Today cafe.  Biggest opportunities for improvement: 1) It’s time for a reboot of the kids areas: curious George, fievel, and Barney all look dated and irrelevant.  2) Would love to see ET rebooted or rebranded into a Strangers Things attraction, Universal has already acquired those rights for HHN.  3) too many simulators. Watching a screen in a moving seat might be cheaper to create but it’s not that fun. Would love to see USF focus on more innovative ride systems instead of motion simulators."
987,2019-7,"I realise that in the current day and age that space is at a premium, but there is simply no excuse for the level of motion simulators in this park It's literally every single ride  Fast and furious ? Not fast nor furious in fact it's a damp squib and not worth waiting for, it's like someone blew the budget for the ride on led lights and fancy cars and never bothered with the ride I expected something like rita queen of speed or Aerosmiths ride. Nope nothing, you dont even have to buckle in it's that tame  But literally every 2nd ride or 2 in 3 are motion simulators ready to make you sick and not thrill you at all Really really disappointed so far"
988,2019-7,"Great time at Universal Studios. The waits can be long, but I believe in not waiting over an hour for any ride. Arrived at one which was a 90 minute plus wait. Instead went and explored other parts of the theme park and then went back and stood for an hour, which in the end did not feel that long. I did not find things to be as overpriced as it could of been. My favorite part of all Disney theme parks is the night life with the lights etc..."
989,2019-7,"My family visited Universal Orlando on January 1 and had a fantastic time! Yes, it is expensive, especially if you buy the fast passes, but it is worth the extra investment to skip the lines and be able to ride anything you want all day over and over with little to no wait. Two days earlier we visited Disney’s Hollywood Studios which was overcrowded and miserable...their fast pass system is a joke...we only got to ride 3 rides all day (and their rides are not good...our kids thought they were boring). We’ll never go to a Disney park again. Pay the extra and go to Universal...the rides are amazing, worth the extra cost, and the crowds aren’t nearly as bad as Disney!"
990,2019-7,"We had a good time. Yes, it's very expensive and some things, like the meals in some of the restaurants, are ridiculously awful for what they charge. Stuff like that I've come to expect out of places like this. On the positive is that the people that make the place work were really very pleasant and helpful. The shows and the decorations for the Christmas holiday were wonderful! My biggest disappointment is how accommodating this venue is to smokers. They have a surprisingly huge number of designated smoking areas. It didn't seem like they discourage or enforce violation of no smoking rules, anywhere on the property! That was really shocking. Even in the areas that are more geared to young children, we saw people walking around smoking cigarettes. We pointed out a couple that were walking along, both smoking to a park security guard and she seemed hesitant to approach them. If Universal doesn't want to join the majority of businesses that have banned smoking, they should at least make it more difficult by forcing the smokers to go away from the non smokers! It was really disgusting!"
991,2019-7,"My reaction was just to keep thinking how expensive it was. I was kind of in shock after paying for the tickets. Everything was very expensive inside the park but not any more so than any other amusement park I've been in. The tickets though (it was like $600 for our family of four; two adults and two kids) just felt so shockingly high. It's party my fault- we did it a little on the spur of the moment and I think I didn't consider just how much the tickets would be.  As for the experience, my 9yo daughter is into Harry Potter and really liked it. We just did the one-park experience because I didn't want to have to mortgage the house in order to do both. I have to say I was impressed with the Escape from Gringotts and the Diagon Alley visit overall. We got there early so the line was like 45 min. to do Escape from Gringotts and we spent probably like another hour or two bouncing around there. Unique and definitely nice for HP fans. It is a unique ride.  After that, we did the Minions ride, which was like just short of 2 hrs. So our day was two rides after getting through that (we left early at 3- just because we needed to get to our next location). Minions was neat but it wasn't like a 2 hr wait neat.  I enjoyed it but there's no way I would have coughed up that amount of money for something like that- except that it's a unique HP experience and my daughter and I have really been doing a lot of those.  My 3 year old son got scared of the dragon in Diagon Alley and had to leave the Alley.  Bitterbeer is good for like 2 sips and then the sweetness overwhelms you.  You should be prepared to drop another almost $60 for the wand because when you get there all the kids are doing to be doing it (there's a lot of stations where they can use it to make neat things happen).  I think I'm still in shock over the price. Nice little day out but not sure it's worth the cost- I'm not sure there are many 1-day travel experiences on earth that are worth that actually. But it was a nice day out."
992,2019-7,"Spent the whole day at Universal Studios park, really nice park I expected to pay high prices for drinks food etc but what I think let’s the park down is the extra charging to use both parks. I really don’t see the point to charge almost double to use 2 parks instead of 1. What Universal have done is basically split 1 park into 2. They have 1 fast rollercoaster in each park along with a few other rides. I paid $119 each or it was £194 for both parks. I don’t think it’s fair to make people pay the extra $75 each to use both parks, the Universal in LA is a much better park.  Overall nice day out but not as good a the park in LA."
993,2019-7,"Visited Universal for two days and decided to get the park-to-park tickets. Highly recommended being able to move between the two, especially for the Hogwarts Express.  There’s a lot of things that are great about Universal studios. A great variety of rides for all ages - but you also have to be ready to do A LOT of waiting.  *Of course I’ll say something about the Hagrid ride... we arrived extra early to try and beat the line. By the time we were let in at 9am, the line was already 6 hours long. I understand it’s popular and there will be lots of people waiting - but surely it would make more sense to have visitors grab a ticket at the entrance of the ride, to come back at a later allocated time, rather than them stand in line for 6 hours.  Universal - you can and you should think of a better way to deal with this. If the choice is between standing for 6 hours or missing out entirely, you’ll probably have to stop saying you pride yourselves on exceptional service."
994,2019-7,"We love coming here as a family. Ages 9-61 had a great time making memories. The price is a little steep for both parks, especially since you have to pay for parking her day. All employees that we came into contact with were very kind!"
995,2019-7,This was our second visit to this park and it didn’t disappoint it’s wonderful for all age there’s something for every one and wizarding world of Harry Potter was fantastic. Last time we came my two older kids got on all the rides and my twins weren’t quite old enough to go on every thing so we came back and they went on every thing we had a wonderful time all of us . Definitely worth every penny loved it had a great time with the family. Sad to come home. Even the restaurants are fun . Would recommend to all . Love universal x
996,2019-7,"Lovely over crimbo, get there early to get on rides, very busy but went more to experience Christmas as been before, glad we did"
997,2019-7,"If your are going to universal on Christmas break DO NOT waste your money on park to park train. I bought 7 passes to ride the train park to park and it was so crowded we were not allowed on train. We were told to walk to 2nd park. It’s upsetting because it was basically money I gave away. My family was at the park on December 26, 2019. We tried getting on train around 9pm. Big disappointment.,"
998,2019-7,"Everything that Disney isn't. The rides are great and uptodate and use CGI brilliantly. Harry Potter rides are fantastic but something needs to be done with the wait times, 5 hours for the Haggrid ride. Costs a lot to enter so why wait 5 hours for 1 ride. Pathetic. Single rider is the best and quickest way to get on rides if it is available."
999,2019-7,We enjoyed visiting Universal Studios since it was a long time since we were there. We thoroughly enjoyed the Indiana Jones show. We don't do thrill rides so a lot of things we didn't participate in. The weather was nice and October was the ideal month to visit the parks since they were not crowded as other months tend to be. I was in a wheelchair and the staff was very good at accommodating us.
1000,2019-7,"We enjoyed our visit to universal studios! We got an early entry and a multi day pass park for new years day. It was to avoid crowds and lines. It was absolutely the right decision. We lined up at 7:30 am, park gates opened at 8 am. We did fast furious which was ok, enjoyed transformers and met bumblebee. We loved mummy ride which is very scary. Despicable me and shrek these are all virtual reality rides. The Christmas tree was beautiful. There are so many shows to watch blues bro, marylin and her singers as well as characters from betty boop, simpsons, back to the future. We enjoyed the mib ride where its more interactive and simpsons ride as well. There is the Macy's parade which is a must do where all the characters can be seen on giant floats. The night show with fireworks and cinematic water experience is very cool. We did all the harry potter rides and got it out of the way. Diagon alley is absolutely fabulous place to visit in the evening and we did dinner at leaky cauldron. Try hot and frozen butter beer and the green ale. We gringots ride and It was our fav ride, they have done a fantastic job with the bank, dragon and the virtual ride. The dragon breathes fire so definitely get a good shot. We went into the single rider line, there was already a 100 min wait. We did that in about 40 min. The single rider line splits your party, its more for families with older kids. My son does not mind riding alone and he waits for us at the end of the ride, or we send him after my husband or I go on the ride, so there is always an adult waiting at the end. It definitely saves hours in waiting and lets us go on rides we like. we took king cross hogwarts train over using our multi day park pass which you need to park hop and do this ride. It was a train ride with images of hogwarts and London in your window. This train ride can have insanely long waits so plan accordingly. It also has different images back and forth to the parks. The train actually takes you to the other park. You arrive at islands of adventure."
1001,2019-7,"Way better than Disney even w/ younger kids! But it is the most expensive park I’ve ever been to. They get us for twice as much money as Disney, but I didn’t feel bad about paying for it. Unless you are a big Harry Potter fan skip the wands... they were a letdown."
1002,2019-7,"We arrived at universal at 4pm on New Year's Day. It took us over and hour to buy tickets although I'd already purchased them using our corporate discount. My young adult children and I packed it in and got on every ride we wanted to before the park closed at 10pm, including Harry Potter. My only complaint is the ticket cost. Over $700 for three people (1 two day pass and 2 one day passes), is not very family friendly. I had never experienced a virtual reality ride, so that was a new a fun experience."
1003,2019-7,"This is a best theme park in Orlando. I love the Harry Potter Wizarding world, me and my family love Harry Potter. Thank you universal studios"
1004,2019-8,Went here with as a family of 2 adults and 2 teenage girls. One word to describe this 2 park attractions is brilliant. Wizarding world of Harry Potter to islands of adventure to city walk. Have been here a few times before. This is definitely the best it has been. Great for kids of all ages ( includes dads ) . 5star.
1005,2019-8,"Universal studios Harry Potter world was fantastic! The only down fall was Hagrid’s motorbike ride had a 3 hour queue at 9.15am! And through the day, the lowest queue time for this was 1h 30 so we didn’t manage to get on it.  There were lots of virtual 3D & 4D rides / shows which is great for those who don’t like roller coasters.  We didn’t have time to do both islands of adventure and universal studios so did have return for a 2nd day."
1006,2019-8,"My wife and I recently took our daughters, buying park hopper passes for just over $1,000 (Dec 29). The parks were insanely busy. The line for the newest Harry Potter ride inside Islands of Adventure was 5 hours long. I kid you not! We didn't spring for the Fast Pass (another $1,500+) but managed to avoid the long lines by joining the Single Rider lines; our kids are aged 15, 17 and 20. The Harry Potter areas are pretty amazing. Both parks are great, but I strongly suggest trying to find a date when the park is less busy."
1007,2019-8,"If it weren't for Transformers and the Mummy ride, we could have completely skipped Universal altogether. Race thru New York will make anyone nauseous to the point they do not want to ride anything else after. I enjoyed Rip Ride Rock-It, but again, more rides would make this park better."
1008,2019-8,"Thought this vacation was going to be for the kids but I had just as much fun as they did. We did both parks in one day but really should have spent two days here. Staff were fantastic and it was fun to walk through Harry Potter, the Simpsons, Jurassic Park etc.  The photopass at universal is not as good as Disney but still worth it. Wish the resolution of the photos was better.  It would be nice to see a wrist band system for rides and photos at universal instead of the tickets /cards."
1009,2019-8,"I read so many websites and watched so many videos about how to optimize your visit to Universal Studios Orlando. But the 2 main advices I will remember are: 1) arrive as early as possible if you can and 2) start your ""Harry Potter pilgrimage"" by Universal Studios (not from Island of Adventures).  We booked a 3 days + 2 nights package (I'll review the Endless Summer hotel separately but it was really nice, in a nutshell). On the first day, we went straight to Diagon Alley (the Harry Potter part). The annoying thing is that you have to first go through the ""City Walk"" (which is just a big mall with lots of overpriced restaurants) then cross the entire Studio park to finally reach the Harry Potter world. In a way, that's the price to ""pay"" but once you are there, fans will be *delighted*.  In Diagon Alley, everything is nearly identical to the books (and the movies - but kids preferred the books). The houses, the shops, the front of shops (the ones you can't go in), the restaurants, the Butter Beer, the Gringotts bank, calling the Ministry of Magic, the night bus, ... Kids were really, really happy!  Of course, you have long queues to some attractions. But if you download the Universal Studios app before, it will tell you how much time you have to wait even before you move there.  Buying the interactive wands is a must for kids - they cost a lot ($50) but provides magic to kids in many places (in the park).  Take the Hogwart Express, go to the other park (you directly reach Hogsmeade) - but come back to Universal Studios, that's the best part of the 2 parks."
1010,2019-8,"Terrible service from universal studios. We waited for 3 1/2 hours. they told us the ride was not working properly about 22 minutes into the line. They would not give us tickets if we left the line for 3 1/2 hours. Universal Should think of the small children, wheel chairs etc before the made us wait for so many hours. Bad service."
1011,2019-8,"Our big family Christmas gift this year was a trip to Universal (we typically cruise the week before or the week after Christmas but decided on Universal this year). We left the day after Christmas and drive down from NC, we opted to stay at a Universal onsite hotel for the early park admission and transportation perks. We have done Universal (and Disney in the past at different times during year and knew from experience it would be crowded). Our main goal was to visit Harry Potter World as it has been a couple of years since we were there, hands down the early park admission is well worth the price of staying onsite. We stayed at Cabana Bay Resort and I booked several months ago (August 2019) so did get a decent price ($254 a night for a standard 2 queen bed regular room) for the 3 of us (2 adults and a teen). Also, we were there for 4 days and once we parked the car at the hotel, we did not drive again until the day we left to drive home, so very, very nice to not have to drive anywhere (or look for a parking place)...  We had the choice of hotel bus (only our hotel straight to park so no other shuttle stops and we were there in minutes) which ran continually from 6:00 AM to past midnight everyday (never waited going from hotel or from park). We could also walk next door to the Blue Sapphire hotel (another Universal onsite hotel) and use the water taxi straight to the parks for hotel guests only. Early admission for this time of year was 7:00 - 8:00 AM with the parks opening to public at 8:00. We caught the hotel bus at 6:30 and it drops you off right at the City Walk section (you do have to go through security of course first) and they let us go right into the parks. We headed for Island of Adventure over to the HP World area (preplan where you want to start), got right in line for whatever attraction was open early that day (it changes from day to day in HP World) and got right on ride within minutes. HUGE time saver as once the gates open to the public your lines get exponentially long VERY quickly.  HP World did not disappoint and we were very satisfied (and grateful) with the early park admission (have to get up early but with hotel so close to park and so easy to transport back and forth, we would go back to hotel for lunch and a nap about 1:00 pm and then return to parks around 5:00 PM when everyone was eating dinner) until after fireworks. We had a great time and quality family time for sure!!!  2 recommendations that will surely help with time management in the parks with the crowds;  Stay onsite if possible, the early park admission is priceless when it comes to crowds and lines and second, ""single rider line"", go for it, beats express line almost every time hands down.  The single rider line is the way to go (very quick access to the rides) and enables you to spend way less time in the lines and do more rides/attractions for the best time management. (we had 2 day, park to park tickets so we could ride the Hogwarts train between the 2 parks). If you are staying at onsite hotel it is very easy to go back to the hotel for a break after the first 5 or 6 hours in the park! Have fun!!!"
1012,2019-8,"The park was packed, which we were expecting since it was the Christmas holidays. We paid $1265.00 for 3 of us for a 1 day 2-park with Express pass tickets. 🤷‍♂️ We didn't spend a lot of time researching what it might cost for the day but that was certainly double or more than we were expecting. We purchased our tickets at the Marriot hotel where we were staying, the employee there told us we'd walk right onto the rides with no wait with the express pass. That was not the case.  We enjoyed most of the rides and the express pass did seem to cut down wait times a little. It took 1 hr instead of 2 hrs to get through The Minions ride, most others were under an hour but not by much. The wait times were a little more than our 7 year old could take but he pushed through it. The Mummy ride was one of our favorites and we happened to jump in right after it reopened from an outage and got seated in 25 minutes. The 3D simulator rides were surprisingly realistic but less thrilling than rollercoaster type rides.  We definitely agree with some other reviewers regarding the staff, especially in the cafe. Most were socializing and only a few ready to get your food out. Lunch was $67 for 3 fried chicken plates and 2 drinks. Most other employees on the rides themselves were friendly and upbeat.  We spent the rest of our days at the hotel pool, which was much more relaxing and enjoyable for everyone.  Wishing this was a positive review but we did not see the value for what we spent. This may be comparable to what other parks charge but if I'm going to spend this kind of money on a vacation, it will be at a resort where I'm waited on hand and foot."
1013,2019-8,"If you go to Universal Studios on a VIP tour, I highly recommend requesting DJ for your guide. He is full of knowledge and very entertaining. He reminds of famous radio legend Casey Casum. The VIP tour was definitely worth it."
1014,2019-8,"This is for young and old!! Really cool especially the Harry Potter part. Enough to eat, to see and to enjoy"
1015,2019-8,"Much less crowded than Epcot, but Universal lacks the Disney magic. Every ride was a stomach churner for those who suffer motion sickness, so we were left with not much to do except that we absolutely adored the Harry Potter Diagon Alley. It was so much fun to see everyone running around in their black robes, waving wands and casting spells. The dragon sitting atop the tower breathes fire every so often, which was great. And they sell butterbeer! It was also fun to see groups of Universal Studio characters--the Simpsons, Scoobie Doo and his gang, and others. The Men In Black ride was lots of fun (although it triggered nausea) and I assume the rest of the rides were also fun. Try this park if you can't face the crowds at Epcot."
1016,2019-8,"We enjoyed staying at Portofino Bay. Wonderful Hotel, but also enjoyed the Express Pass that went with it. We were able to skip so many very long lines. There are a lot of 3D and Simulators. But they are enjoyable. The detail that is put into the environment is probably my favorite part. it's like walking into the movies. Highly recommend."
1017,2019-8,"My family LOVED Volcano Bay. Loved. Everyone had such an amazing time, there were activities for all of us (5 people). My thrill seekers loved the drop water slides, while my oldest and I found our happy place with the water coaster and wave pool. The staff were helpful and pleasant, particularly Carl. We met Carl our first day assisting with lockers, and again another day offering help to those who needed it. When we booked our trip going to Volcano Bay was not high on our priority list, as it felt like an unneeded bonus to Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure. It quickly became a favorite and was our first stop Christmas morning! Highly recommend for anyone one the fence about going to Volcano Bay...do it!!! PS We had no little ones (9 was our youngest) but it seemed there was plenty for them to do. Yes there were rides that catered to older kids and up but the area for the littles looked fun. I’m sure if our kids were younger they would have still enjoyed Volcano Bay."
1018,2019-8,"I enjoy Universal Studios very much and knew that the lines would be bad the week of Christmas, so we splurged for VIP tours. We had 9 in our family and had to break into 2 groups or we would have been charged for a private tour. We had DJ as our tour guide and he took us to the front of the line on lots of rides in both parks. He told us some interesting things and took us on the quick ""backlot"" route between the parks. We didn't get to see anything about how rides worked(the other family group did). DJ did help our group get on Hagrid's ride at the end of our tour as it started to rain! Our tour included breakfast but we only had 10 min. to eat because we didn't know how much time it would take to park & get checked in(allow an hour). It also included a fabulous lunch. My only complaint is that my husband, who is a big & tall guy, fits on every ride at Disney and almost nothing at Universal. I know the ride engineers have to design seats for all body sizes but I would like to see a ""bigger"" seat put in so they can ride too."
1019,2019-8,"We had an amazing time last week at Universal Studios. With the exception of a few rides, we were able to do everything we wanted while there. My family had five day tickets for all three parks. We did not purchase the express pass for our visit; we contemplated doing it for at least one day but mainly relied on the Universal app for wait times. Ride times varied, we had to check the app often but it was worth it. We also utilized the single-rider lines for shorter wait times. Our only complaint - the Fast and the Furious ride was a disappointment. It was confusing, short and very lackluster. If it’s a must do for your visit - by all means go for it. My family enjoyed all of the holiday decorations and the parade. Our Warm Christmas was a success - and we look forward to hopefully doing it again."
1020,2019-8,"The parks are smaller than Disney Parks, but there is just as much fun. Lots of things and rides to see and do. Highly recommend."
1021,2019-8,"We stopped for one day and got the park hopper ticket to get as much as we could out of it. It was holiday break and a day before new year's eve so we knew it would be crowded. We only got in about 6 rides due to lines, was still good but I thin I would only buy a single park ticket in the future."
1022,2019-8,Great adventure by the family. Family friendly and fun place to visit. Love the settings and the ease of going around.
1023,2019-8,"We had 3 day 3 park tickets. We didn't go to Volcano Bay, so that gave us extra time at the other two parks. We mainly spent a lot of time in Harry Potter areas. I didn't go on that many rides, but my daughter and her friend went on most of them. They avoided the Hulk one though. I went on the Jurassic Park ride and nearly had heart attack!! The light show at night was magical. It repeats every hour after sunset, so if you missed one you can wait for the next one. We thoroughly enjoyed it. The newest ride was either had a long que or closed every time we tried. We ate at the Leaky Cauldron and Mythos. the girls purchased multi day Halloween Horror night tickets and went 3 nights. They said it waas fantastic."
1024,2019-8,"My grandsons really enjoy Fear Factor. They came last year (2018) and loved it and it was their favorite activity again this year in 2019. When we came last year your employee, Joey, took a special interest in them and we took pictures with him. This year he asked the boys to stay afterwards and he offered to give them a tour. It absolutely made our day. Joey is one wonderful employee!!"
1025,2019-9,universa; [s a grat park for familys that love thrill ride and dr suess land is a wonderful place the only drawback is it is pricey if you have a large family start saveing now it is worth it.
1026,2019-9,"Visited with my family including 2 kids aged 10 and 5yr old gals. We booked for 2days-2park entry. We chose the universal studio and Universal Islands of Adventure. While booking, we contemplated buying the express pass. In hindsight- it was a mixed decision. Our family was not crazy about the roller coasters but we focused on the 3D/4d Let me share some valuable details 1. Choose your hotel wisely depending on the number of days. The hotels inside universal come with express entry. It may work out cheaper if you do that. We had not done enough research and booked a hotel on International drive that was 10 min by Uber. We bought the 2 days 2 park pass which also gives you access to the Hogwarts express train between Universal studio and Islands of Adventure. 2. We did not purchase the express entry as we used that day to get acclimatized with the 2 parks. We were there at 8am sharp which was the park opening time. If you stay at any of the universal hotels, you get entry 1hr before the rest of the public. Here are some of our experiences with the rides and 3D/4d experiences 3. Download the Universal app and use that for the map and choose the rides which you want to do. Add them to your favorites list in the app. The app also shows options for food. 4. Food, beverages and snacks are expensive. Even Starbucks inside is more expensive. We brought 2 back packs and carried beverages and snacks and it’s allowed to be brought in. 5. Bring your own lanyards from outside as the ones in the parks cost 12 dollars each. You get to buy lanyards outside at 3 dollars or less each. The lanyards can be used for the express passes as these are required to be scanned at all the rides. 5. We bought the express pass with single entry as we wanted to do all the rides only once. The unlimited entry universal pass is only good if you like to repeat the rides. 6. We rented the large stroller for 2 days. Each day you have to rent it separately as both our gals get tired walking very fast. So it was definitely worth the 28 dollars for each day. Single strollers are 18 dollars each day. 7. Photo packages are not worth it according to me. Click your own with your phone/camera with characters around the Park. There are Universal staff who click your pics for free for the characters. 8. Express entry prices vary each day. If you are going during school holidays, you will need them.  In universal studios using the express pass we did: 1. Harry Potter and escape from Gringotts( one of the best experiences). My 5yr old was not allowed. so we used Child swap which is amazing thing because my wife and 5yr old waited next to the ride while I did it with my 10yr old.once we finished, my wife did it immediately. It’s a great feature. Excellent and do not miss. 2. ET( only good for kids below 7-8). Very low on thrills for the rest 3. Transformers : good fun for all ages. 4. Men in black: good fun as you get to shoot at aliens. Good for all ages. 5. Jimmy Fallon: good experiences for all for the race through New York. Don’t miss. 6. Shrek : good for small kids. Boring for some adults and my 10yrd old also found it less exciting. 7. Minion: good for all ages. 8. Woody woodpecker roller coaster: okay for all ages.  In Island adventure: we used Express pass for 1. Kong: reign of terror. Excellent for all of us. 2. Spider-Man: good fun for all ages.  Without express pass my wife and 10yr old did the Harry Potter and the forbidden journey which was amazing but ended up waiting for 2hrs as on day 1, we hadn’t purchase the express entry. Definitely would do it with Express pass.  We also did the the Hogwarts express train which was okay and more hyped than what it really is. Its just the nostalgia of riding the Harry Potter train at 9 3/4th station.  Woody woodpecker, Simpson and Suess are targeted towards toddlers and small kids below 8yrs.  Express pass wait time was maximum 15-20 minutes. Without express wait times for these rides ranged between 70-120 minutes.  Express entry was required only for one day for us as we could complete the rides that we selected within 8am to 5pm. But if you also like the roller coasters and the Water rides in Island of adventure, then take the express pass for 2 days.  Things that Universal can do better for 1st time visitors. 1. Ask more people on entering the parks to download the app so that the paper maps are not wasted. Also the app shows waiting times for each rides so you know if you don’t have express pass, then you can use that to choose your next ride. 2. Ask / have sign directing people to use the right side of the street in their direction so that people can walk better in a busy park. 3. Have more visible water fountains for people to be able to hydrate and refill their water bottles. 4. Reduce /eliminate the use of single use plastic where possible 5. In the app: also show the wait time for each ride for express entry also. 6. In some rides express entry merges you with the regular pass holders. This should be avoided and express entry should get access to the ride without merging."
1027,2019-9,If you like simulation 3D/4d rides then this park is for you. However for me and my family it was just a huge waste of money. The only ride I enjoyed was ET as it felt like a classic theme park ride and I didn’t feel like my senses were being assaulted. I visited Universal Studios in CA many decades ago as a teenager and absolutely loved it. This park was a huge disappointment. Even my kids weren’t impressed. So many shops and overpriced junk to buy everywhere...definitely not my cup of tea. Maybe island of adventure is better but just didn’t want to spend any more money or waste another holiday day at Universal...
1028,2019-9,"Parking was a cinch. There were long lines everywhere but once we went as solo riders, that was not as bad. Enjoyed the rides. I had downloaded the app and found it good for finding weight times. The paper map was not great."
1029,2019-9,You must stay on property with a premier hotel to get Express Pass without paying. We arrived on 12/19-12/28 & had we not upgraded we would have maybe gotten 3-4 rides per day minimum. Express pass decreased our wait times to less than an hour & some even 30 minutes or less. You can buy at park but it worked out better through the hotel price wise for us.
1030,2019-9,"Absolutely amazing. Primarily went for the Harry Potter attractions but the entire park was fantastic. Food and drinks are a bit pricey, but that's to be expected at such an attraction. Merchandise is quality, and prices are what you'd expect. We went on a day that the park wasn't completely crammed so that made it better, which I would recommend doing because there was still quite a bit of people. All in all, would gladly do it again."
1031,2019-9,"We went to Universal during the Christmas season this year and it wasn't terribly crowded. Now don't get me wrong, there were a bunch of people there, but the trick is to go during the week if you can. We got on most rides during the day in 45 to 30 mins for the most part, after 3 pm is when it starts to pick up, so getting to the park early is definitely beneficial if you want to ride some of the rides that have long waits (Hagrids was 90+ every day, even at the open of the park). We also found that Hagrids ride closed earlier than the park most days so try to be in line before 4 pm. *It's entirely worth the wait if you were wondering* Initially, we were struggling with whether to buy a base ticket or park to park passes. I will say the only added benefit to park-to-park is the Hogwarts express. The way from Kings Cross to Hogsmede is the best, but to get back from Hogsmede to Kings Cross is sometimes a longer wait than if you just walked. You will need park-to-park in order to go from the Island of Adventures to Universal Studios Florida, they scan your tickets at the entrance of the Hogwarts express rides. Also, Diagon Alley is in Universal Studios Florida, so you will need park-to-park if you want to visit it on the same day as the other park, but you could do 2 base tickets and plan to see it the next day. If you choose to buy a wand, your only chance to use it will likely be in Diagon Alley. We bought our wands at Ollivanders and it was a neat show, I am pretty sure they do something similar in Hogsmede as well. Hogsmede was packed to the nines, so much so, you could hardly move without bumping into someone just walking. The lines to cast spells were becoming an attraction of their own, even the bathroom lines were unbelievably long. I will say this if you are going to only buy a base ticket, Island's of Adventure has a bulk of the big attractions. Marvel Superhero's Island, has a few great rides ESPECIALLY Spiderman Adventures. That was our second favorite ride in the park. There is also the lost continent, Jurassic Park *bit of a letdown*, Toon Lagoon and Seuss Landing. Universal Studios Florida has the Rip Ride Rockit, Simpsons Character Zone, The Revenge of the Mummy (excellent ride imo), Transformers, Minions, Shrek 4D, and as I mentioned before Diagon Alley. I would say for both parks you probably can do them all in 2 days if you are aggressive and want to get through the parks quick. 3 days would probably be plenty! We had 4 days and it was far too much time at the parks. I am sure this all depends on the time of year, but if you go during the Christmas season (we went the 19th-22nd) and we rode mostly everything and even rode most of our favorite rides 3 times. All in all, it was a blast! I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to take their family or to just let your inner child take over!"
1032,2019-9,"I have three teens and we go to A LOT of water parks! This is the first water park that genuinely has warm water!! My daughter and I normally have to take our time getting used to the cold water at other parks. Not here. We walked right in and never felt uncomfortable! The virtual ride lines allow you to save your spot in line while you go do other rides or activities. I wish all parks did this!! No waiting in line for hours for a three minute ride. There were plenty of different rides, but our favorite was the Fearless River. Our family could do it together as many times as we wanted! Premium Seating-not worth it. Since we have teens who sleep in we were worried we may not get chairs getting there after 11 so we paid for premium seating. What a waste. There were so many loungers tucked away in every nook and cranny. The premium seating did NOT come with towels or even a lounge cover. You have to bring your own towels or pay $6/towel to rent them. The towels don’t cover the lounger so plan on renting two if you want the lounger covered. There was plenty of shade so the seating cover was unnecessary. I recommend saving your money."
1033,2019-9,"This was our first time going Universal’s Studios, really enjoyed ourself. We be better prepared for when we go again. I think my biggest complaint is how expensive it is and they don’t seem to offer a good package that will cover cost of everything like Disney. The food in the park is very expensive and not real tasty. Also, we bought one day express pass (also was expensive) but since it was peak time it helped us enjoy more rides.  The only other real issue we had was the locker system! You have stow bags before you read most rides. It total chaos getting bag in locker because rooms are cramped and hot. If it small bag then if free but a larger bag it a $2.00 charge for each time. That was extremely frustrating specially if you have children and larger pack-back.  We did the VIP tickets it was worth it, but extremely expensive! You spend a day with a tour guide, go little bit back stage and go straight front the lines! It 5 hr your includes breakfast, meal card then unlimited express pass for rest of day. Plus VIP to parade.  We loved all the rides! My kids favorite was Mummy, rip red rollercoaster, and the Harry Potter. ET is one last original rides at the park! Most of the rides are 3D or 4D animation so you have issue with motion sickness keep that in mind. The character experience is awesome. Short lines, they have fun and interactive with guest. You can find a lot of characters on Hollywood Blvd throughout day. Need a break from heat and walking go the monster make-up show! The Christmas parade was shot but very nice. We enjoyed the Macy balloons. Also, plenty space to watch parade with it being overwhelming.  Harry Potter World is super crowed!! Also, around the Simpsons! The line to get a Krusty burger was extremely long.  You have walk through CityWalk get into the theme park! I loathed that long crowded walk after a long day at park. Also, you have by a two park ticket with a hopper pass to ride Hogwarts express."
1034,2019-9,"Stay in a Loews property with Front of the line access and you can enjoy this entire park in one day. Loved Diagon Alley and all the experiences, such as Despicable Me, Shrek, The Mummy, and Transformers. Great day, good restaurants, and fireworks at the end of the night."
1035,2019-9,"We mainly went to the parks to see the Harry Potter area and rides the rides. We do recommend getting there BEFORE the time they say the parks open. We were there both days about 8:30 a.m. and were allowed in right away. Warning: there is a LOT of walking and there are THRONGS of people. The first day, there was a huge crowd entering Islands of Adventure. And we hurt from walking so much by the end of our visit. We were able to get into 3 rides without having to wait that morning! We ate at the Leaky Cauldron. The second day, we got in even faster at the entrance to Universal Studios! There were more people the second day and when we were leaving (about noon), we had to wade through throngs of people to leave. If I were to plan this trip again, I would only go 1 day. And the Hogwarts Express is NOT worth the extra money. Just my opinion!"
1036,2019-9,"Great fun, very busy so be prepared for long wait times. MIB not in operation which was a shame but other rides -Simpson’s, Rip Ride Rocket and Diagon Alley fabulous. Love the Universal Parks 💜"
1037,2019-9,"If you like roller coasters, Universal Studios Orlando is a place you'll want to visit. All the roller coasters are themed and different and some you'll even get a bath you didn't expect. Don't miss dining at one of the City Walk restaurants, all right there at the entrance. The shows are excellent too!"
1038,2019-9,"We have been to HHN at universal studios several times. Our Disney/Universal expert, Robyn, with Dream Makers Vacation Services, really came through for us on this trip. I consider myself pretty good on knowing the ins and outs of Universal, but Robyn gave me some great advice on new restaurants at Citywalk, and rides at the parks. Stranger Things and Us were two of our top houses this year. Always get the express pass for HHN. And the new Hagrids roller coaster is the best I’ve ridden!!! Amazing!!"
1039,2019-9,"Universal Studios Florida does not disappoint. There is a different ride for everyone in the family, from rollercoasters, to Harry Potter to E.T./Simpsons. There is something fro everyone. My personal favorite rides at USF is Rip Rockit, Mummy and Gringotts! They are a def MUST! SKIP Fast and the Furious, not worth the wait. GO in to Diagon Alley and experience everything it has to offer. Make sure to stroll through Simpson Land, MIB and E.T. They are great rides and oldies. Do not miss the Universal Orlando's Cinematic Celebration at night. It's an amazing show with great music!"
1040,2019-9,very expensive. waited amost an hour to buy tickets.you need to buy Express pass or don't even bother. lines are over 2 hours for each premier ride if you have regular ticket.Even food lines are extremely long. charged $40 for pizza. don't go during holiday weeks.
1041,2019-9,"The technology on the many of rides is amazing (Harry Potter rides in particular). The express pass does help shorten the wait times a bit, but it does not reduce the wait to zero (which is more of the case at Disney). Currently the express pass does not apply at the new Harry Potter motorbike adventure, which would have been good to know in advance and the wait will cost you about 4 hours (we decided to pass).  Areas for improvement:  The locker situation is extremely confusing. You have to store your bags and accessories at some rides and not others. In some you use your park ticket, and at others you use your fingerprint. Small lockers are free; larger ones cost money. For the prices of park admission they should all be free. At virtually every locker room there was mass confusion amongst the patrons.  Walking around the park was very challenging, especially in the Harry Potter areas. The streets are very narrow and very crowded. Not sure what can be done about this now, but if you have small kids it’s very unsettling.  Every ride has a giant disclaimer (do you suffer from: motion sickness, sudden movements, drops, aversion to mist / gas, etc.). It felt like the Legal department had taken over, and it got to be too much. Enough already.  Overall we would do it again, but you are there for the rides. The “experience” was lacking."
1042,2019-9,"Ok, we know Harry Potter area of the park is amazing (it has it's own review separate from this)! There were some other hits and a couple misses: unexpected good ride was Revenge of the Mummy and Jimmy Fallons race through New York (which had no line) was better than anticipated. MISS: Fast and Furious was horrible, just dont waste your time. Men in Black was ok, my 13 year old was disappointed by it. Transformers were ok -a lot of rides are 3D/4D and are ok."
1043,2019-9,"This is just a beautiful place, if you don’t enjoy the rides, you can just look stound and be amazed. The simpsons’ ride is great!!! We visited during Christmas and the lanes were huge."
1044,2019-9,"Insanely long queues for very short rides, the majority of which are 3D simulators . didn't buy the fast passes the cost was far too extreme. Saw people who had purchased them and were complaining saying that they were still waiting too long, so it's a waste of money.  Both parks were far too over crowded and chaotic, it felt dangerous in some areas. Awful loud music blaring everywhere and on some rides like Kong the volume is way too excessive.  Cant take bags on some rides like men in black, there is a sign saying "" free lockers"" when you get there it's not ""free"" at all.  Staff looked totally miserable and fed up.  Used to be a great place in the 90s the whole place felt like one big scam and totally lost it's way.  Won't be coming back , will go to disney where they do things properly."
1045,2019-10,"We bought a day pass since we didn't stay for many days. It wasn't as crowded as I anticipated. We did not buy the express pass, and wait in line was only 5-30 minutes in the morning and became more crowded in the later afternoon. Mummy ride was our favorite, which we went on twice. We packed our drink and some snacks but ate lunch at the park. A personalized pizza was $14, and bottled water was $5 as expected. We also used the hotel's free shuttle service. Overall, it was a lot of fun."
1046,2019-10,"Good: Harry Potter stuff was very well done, this seemed to be the only part of the parks that was on par or better than Disney quality. Everything was well thought out and looked great. Hagrids is really good and I would rather wait the 2+ hours for that than ride any of the other rides regardless of wait time. Hulk and all of the water rides in islands of adventure are also really fun.  Bad: There is way too many screen based attractions. If you like these, universal will be a great choice for you. I find them to be unimaginative and boring. Most people love Spider-Man and Transformers, I thought they were very jerky and annoying. Gringots and Forbidden journey also use screens, but they have much smoother, more enjoyable rides in my opinion. Jimmy Fallon was kind of impressive, I’m glad I walked right on otherwise it would have been disappointing as well. Fast and the furious is terrible, if it has less than a 10 minute wait it’s worth checking out I guess. I thought it was poorly made. You can see the edge of the screens and the warehouse rafters above them. Kong is similarly built, but at least that one felt somewhat immersive. This isn’t just a universal problem, everyone seems to love Avatar Flight of Passage at Disney, I thought it was just ok.. I don’t get why people wait 3 hours for it or stay on property just say they can book a 60 day fast pass for it.  Staff: Universal staff seem uninterested and unhappy. It’s like all of the people who couldn’t get or keep their job at Disney. An example of this was at a Butterbeer stand. On the side that was facing Hogsmead there was a line of about 30 people. I happened to walk to the Jurassic Park bridge to take a castle picture and noticed you could also get a Butterbeer on that side of the cart. I interrupted the employees conversation to ask if that side was open or if the line started back where everyone else was.. it was, they served me, then went back to hiding and talking on that side while the people on the other side tried to serve the 30 people in line that clearly didn’t know there were 2 serving stations. Rides were also incredibly inefficient at times with filling all of the seats. This is fine when there is no line, unacceptable the day after Christmas and people are waiting over 2 hours for everything. Security entrance was the same way. The stands next to the escalators had huge lines. In the middle there were about 5 security stations with no one in line and the security guards standing there talking. I walked up, asked if they were open, one of them kind of nodded so I walked through. No one was concerned with trying to minimize wait time for people paying a ton of money to be there. This stuff never happens at Disney. There is always someone directing people to the shortest line, filling all available rides seats, and maximizing efficiency."
1047,2019-10,"We all love Harry Potter in my family and this made a great surprise Christmas present for my kids. We stayed in Loews Royal Pacific and got the Express Passes for all 3 days we visited the parks. I would not visit this park without the passes as the lines get WAY too long.  We also bought the My Universal Photo's pass. This was a complete waste of money. There are not enough rides with in-ride photos to justify it. The random photographers at the entrances take sub par photos and are not creative at all. They all have you do the same peace sigh, thumbs up and hug. Then when you actually see the photo, the border added to it cuts off heads and makes the photos look funny. Pretty sure they take random people and show them how to focus a camera and push the shutter button. Good photos take more effort than that to make the pictures look good and proportional. The character photographers are a little better, but when the border was added, our Grinch had half his head chopped off. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. The character places will use your camera for the photo if you want and they come out better.  As for the concessions/food. Seriously $5 for a bottle of water is highway robbery. A soda costs less at around $4. Heck, i got a margarita for $8.50. I get making money, but that is ridiculous. If you can, take your own water bottles in if you can.  Many rides require you to put all loose items in a locker. I know our lockers were all free, but we learned quickly that not much fits in the free ones. A full size backpack would not fit. Maybe find a smaller bag that will. My wife carried a Kavu cross-body bag that fit perfectly.  I highly recommend going, but research first so you are prepared."
1048,2019-10,"The visit to this park was the biggest waste of money that I ever made! I paid $198 extra per person for the express “skip the line” passes for everyone in my party of five and I feel completely duped, robbed even, as we waited in line for 50 minutes for the Escape from Gringotts ride and am currently 30 minutes into my “express” wait for the minion ride with no end in sight. I feel like a complete fool and Universal should be ashamed of themselves for marketing these as “skip the line” express passes. This is a boldfaced lie!!! At Disney the same week, we walked right onto the rides that we had fast passes for. Disney is far superior in its handling of this!!!!"
1049,2019-10,"We had a great time at the park, it was super busy the day after Christmas though so it was great we had express passes to skip the long lines."
1050,2019-10,Overpriced for simulation rides - real coasters was what we expected ! Not enough rides to keep the kids interest - skip this park - pick Island of Adventure if travelling with teenagers - this park good for younger families. From parking cost to admission it was not worth it! Only redeeming thing was CityWalk (no admission required) lots of food varieties and reasonably priced.
1051,2019-10,"The Unlimited Express Pass is a total joke after 4:00pm. They don’t tell you up front that ALL Season Pass holders get access to the Express line after 4:00. It nullifies the pass. Spending the day trying to hit all the rides with Express Passes takes till 4 anyway. Also, you just don’t want to sell your soul and wait in the Hagrid line for 5+ hours. Folks actually are doing it and are miserable. The parks are so over priced and the rides shut down routinely. We were stuck in 2 lines that got 30+ min delays. The food is ok, but 3x too pricey. Just not a good experience compared to what the Orlando options are. Harry Potter is a visually cool area, but that’s it. Quickly becomes too crowded to enjoy. The warm butter beer is the best thing about Universal. I’m filing a real complaint with them about non-disclosure, but sure it will fall on deaf ears."
1052,2019-10,"This was definitely a great short visit. Do note that we rode everything we could in two days, and we didn't feel rushed. We had an free extra day where we slept in and planned to ride the Hagrid Magical Creature Motorbike Adventure (which wait time can go for 3 hours), do some souvenir shopping and do 2nd rounds for rides we enjoyed.  We thought the three days were a good amount of time at a relatively leisurely pace. I think previous reviewers who said there are not much adult rides is a relative judgement. I am thirty-three and my favourite ride was the Escape from Gringotts (which can arguably be directed to children). I thought the simulation rides where super impressive, the actual roller coasters were great! If there was anything that I would say was a let down, it was the food.Three broomsticks and the leaky cauldron was just an okay eats. But do try Lard Boy's (Simpsons) doughnut which was pretty good.  Overall, such a great visit (except I do not appreciate being called a muggle. Shut up, Malfoy!)"
1053,2019-10,Waited six months to come ride Hagrids motorbike. It was broken for hours all four days we were here. Multiple reviews and people in the park say it breaks down a lot. What gives? Why can’t you fix it? So disappointed. It’s bad enough that express pass people kill the thrill. Nothing like having it shoved in your face that you save money to come here but can’t pay $176 per person per day extra for express pass. At fast and furious 48 people were passed through before one person in the regular line could enter. You know express people can wait like five minutes once in a while. System totally sucks!
1054,2019-10,Cool place to visit but too busy. So many people and people who are not familiar with their surroundings. Walked and tripped over people not paying attention....and owe usual another park that is over priced
1055,2019-10,Not many big rides better theme parks in the uk. I feel its geared more for young children rather than teenagers and adults. Wouldn't bother returning but it was an experience.
1056,2019-10,"I purchased the tickets to the park whilst they were on special offer, 14 days for the price of 7. This was a park hopper ticket for the 3 park ticket, which gives you entrance to Universal Studio, Islands of Adventure, Volcano Bay along with evening access to the bars and clubs in City Walk.  Universal Studios as I’m sure you can imagine is based around a film set and really has some excellent attractions. Bearing in mind that we were two adults visiting the park I can’t really comment on the kids ride. It’s fair to say though that at Universal Studio there are a lot of rides and side attractions for kids.  Due to the time of year that we attended the queue times were really short which allowed us to ride more than once..  The Simpsons Ride has been upgraded from the Back to the Future Ride and is based on the Krustyland theme park. This is a must for any Simpsons fan.  Revenge of the Mummy Based on the film, this is a high speed rollercoaster ride in the dark with sudden twists, turns and surprises.  Men in Black Is now a little dated, but is still good fun. You are appointed as a rookie agent as you make your way through the top secret underground headquarters. You then board a training vehicle and shoot ""the scum of the universe"" who have escaped from their intergalactic prison transport.  E.T. Adventure Although the film was released years ago, this ride is still as good today as it was when it was opened. On this ride you help ET save the green planet.  The Transformers 3D You are recruited to save Earth from Megatron and his Decepticons.  The Hollywood Rip Ride Rocket Listen to your favourite tracks whilst being taken up at 90 degrees, before dropping down and accelerating to 65mph in this very intense rollercoaster.  This park is so much fun."
1057,2019-10,"Take a water flask, they will fill it up with water at any drink station. Buy a lanyard before you go to store your express pass and park pass, they are $12 in park. Only your best walking shoes. Use the restroom outside of hogsmeade because they only have one in this area. Take limited things so that they fit in the free lockers. Buy keepsakes on your way out. Don’t miss the Hagrid ride. It is worth the wait. When you enter the room for the 4D film go as far up and to the left as possible. You will jump I’m front of many others. The light show is great but if your leaving the park you will not be allowed to move back towards Hogsmeade, everyone is sent out the exit through Jurassic park. The Shrek ride is only worth it for 10yr and below. Fennigans was a great place to eat. Get a seat and send the kids across the street to ride revenge of the mummy. Buy the daily meal plan or take a lunch. Back a poncho for the wet rides or change into a swim suite, do those last. Water shoes would be best so that your not walking around in wet tennis shoes. Don’t forget to take the video at Hogsmeade station of the kids facing into the wall. You will have to pay attention and stay back to record.."
1058,2019-10,"I visited Universal studios Florida in December, it is a great place to have family fun, however it should also be called Wait Time Universal studios. The wait times for rides and activities that the park offers to their guest are poor for the price of the product being offered. The should be working to have a minimum wait time. The Park allows so much guest of a given day as such guests spend their time waiting in line for more than an hour, all fir a 3 or 5 min activity. My experience made me question much did the Park value my presence as a guest. Other than the wait time it a pleasant, exciting place to visit. The staff was very helpful and courteous."
1059,2019-10,"We enjoyed our visit to Universal, the rides were good, we enjoyed the Transformer one the most. In the evening it was less crowded."
1060,2019-10,Bartender at universal studios kiosk who is dark skinned with black curly hair should be fired. Provided terrible service. Don’t know how universal hired her in the first place. Very rude and clearly didn’t want to be there. Avoid her at all costs.
1061,2019-10,"I got the fast pass for 1 day at 2 parks, this one included. I highly suggest going first thing in the morning and fast walking (dont run! you could seriously slip and hurt yourself with wet pavement - also get scolded by park workers.) straight to Hagrids bike ride. It's the hotness as of this post. WARNING if you're claustrophobic, there is a section inside the castle that's basically a 'cave' while you wait in line. This line can last up to 2-3 hours on some days even showing up right away, and the ride 'breaks down' frequently from my 2 stays.  The ride itself was great though and you cannot use a fast pass on it, which is why i suggest going to it first thing. Then hit your other main rides with your pass.  PROTIP - USE THE APP FOR WAIT TIMES!"
1062,2019-10,"Universal Studios has always been an awesome vacation for me and my wife. We have been annual pass holders for about 5 years. We generally stay 1.5 miles from the park. We have actually walked to the park faster than most people take to drive, park and walk to the entrance.  The staff are always friendly helpful. We have had several team members go above and beyond for us.  If you use the app you can navigate the park easier and find out line wait times. By going to the rides with the shortest wait times we were able to get 6 rides in under 2 hours on December 25.  Many people incorrectly estimate the distance from the parking garage to the park entrance. At the furthest parking space you may find yourself walking 1/2 a mile.  If you pay attention to all the signs, monitors in the waiting lines/ queues you will see all you need to know for each ride. The app also gives ride restrictions such as height and weight. So if you are unsure if you can ride, look at the app. For those with unusual body proportions they do have test chairs at the entrance of each ride. If you don't want to do the walk of shame, ( been there done that) sit in the chair. If you don't fit don't go on the ride. Also the app will help if you don't enjoy waiting in line for your food. Some restaurants have online ordering. Imagine ordering your food and walking in to pick it up. You may have a line to pick up online orders, however it will be considerably shorter. So I conclude my review/ advice with these words. Use the app and follow the directions."
1063,2019-10,"Hubby and I did a special Orlando Informer event party from 5-midnight. We didn't have to fight big long lines which was nice. Some of the rides of very thrilling, but they jerk you around a lot. I have a sensitive back! (I don't have problems at WDW). We were let down with Wizarding World HP, didn't live up to all the hype. Butterbeer is butterscotch with cream, extremely sweet. We liked the MIB ride. The one thing that really hacked us off, was you get up to a ride, and then the employees tell you no bags, backpacks, etc allowed. You then have to go put your belongings into a locker, which is a LONG trek away! This happens on many of the rides. Also, the restrooms are not kept as neat and clean as the competition. I never saw any restroom attendants. WE missed the entrance for the main ride in Jurassic park, and had to go back around. The sign was 'hidden' under a kids campground play area sign!"
1064,2019-10,"I do not understand how anyone could feel that going to the park during the holidays could be enjoyable. We bought a four day park pass and did enjoy the park two days prior to the week of Christmas, but returned on Christmas Eve to find the park packed so tightly we decided to leave and not even return to use our fourth day pass. Using the lockers to store your items is a disorganized mess as well as all of the Harry Potter lands. The express pass is price gouging and makes it a very elitist feeling for those waiting in regular lines. At least Disneyland makes it fair for everyone without a additional expense. Packed in like sardines is not my cup of tea for the price we paid. Three rides in 6 hours....booo"
1065,2019-11,"Chelsie, a worker at the entrance to islands of adventure, unfairly let some random families into the park early. She took them out of line and let them pass families who had been waiting in line for an hour because they had a good conversation. This does not sit well with me, and universal should let people know in advance if this is going to happen."
1066,2019-11,"We came to Universal for 7 days. We have three left and would head home now if we could. We came to Universal for Christmas 4 years ago and it was wonderful and magical. That was before they built 3 new hotels. Universal has built more hotels than they have room for at the parks. Early Park admission is a joke since so far the only park we could go to is Universal so everyone at the hotels goes there so even at 8am you are packed in like sardines. If you get the interactive wands you can't even get to the windows to use them because so many people are pushing and shoving. There aren't enough lockers for the rides that require them and you can't get to see the shows, such as the lights on Hogwarts because you are corralled into one small area of Hogsmead. Shopping is miserable because the stores are not big enough for the amount of people they let into the park. The photo pass is great for the rides but the character photos are almost impossible because of all the lines. We picked Universal because it used to be so much better organized and run than Disney, but now it is just a crazy free for all that took all the joy from the park."
1067,2019-11,"We went here in March of 2012 and returned for 2019 Christmas. It was so much fun. They have everything decorated so nice for Christmas. They really have it all put together and a good system here. I recommend getting the Express Pass, it helps knock out alot of waiting time."
1068,2019-11,"It has been quite a long time when we visited universal studios and this visit is not disappointing, in fact it’s very fun and entertaining. The rides are very good, realistic and very fun. To save time, if you don’t mind your group to be split up during a ride then go for single rider line, if available, as it can saves you a lot of time. Harry Potters, Fast and Furious, Transformers and Men in Black are excellent and must to do rides / visited. If you have park to park tickets then make sure to ride the Hogwarts express train rides, as it is very2 good... Landscape is very nice, and there are a lot of food options... admission price is quite high though."
1069,2019-11,"We live in Orlando and decided to do a staycation, what an amazing idea! The kids, which are teens, really enjoyed it! Our favorite park is Universal Studios. ET is still a fun ride and now the kids are looking forward to the new movie in 2020."
1070,2019-11,"This was the first time our family had been to Universal. First off we did not know the difference between the parks. We went to universal studios and Island of Adventure. Universal Studios had one roller coaster and mostly 4D type rides. There was so much to see and do for all ages. I hate roller coasters, as does my 6 year old, but my 13 year old loves them. There was enough to do and see that everyone had a good experience. One thing I had wished I known was that we could bring outside food. That would have really helped with cost inside the park. (One corn dog was $10.) I would have brought a backpack as well to more easily carry out stuff. We had lots of fun! Definitely will go back. If you’re a first timer like me and cheap, check with your hotel about shuttle service as parking starts at $26/day. There is a lot to be said about being picked up vs searching for the car after a long day of walking."
1071,2019-11,"Not my cup of tea, I was a little disappointed. It is mostly shops and food joints. The turkey leg my grandson bought was very good. There was a show with fire and waster that was really cool."
1072,2019-11,I visited the park yesterday on a family vacation and feel cheated. My family of 5 paid approximately $1400 for a three day pass... (or doing the math essentially $93 a day) We are here on an 8 day trip and did Disney as well. Disney builds a fast pass into the base price of their ticket and quite honestly feels like a better value. At Universal you basically double the price of your ticket ( an eye watering $200) to feel like you are getting the same benefit. Standing in line is basically a social contract where you put up with the irritation because you feel like you are all in it together; Universal breaks that trust by essentially letting people “line jump” for $200 a day. It really does negatively impact the majority of people who do not fork over for the express pass. It makes my $93 feel more like $45. It’s annoying enough that I will not be coming back. Disney to me is the better value.
1073,2019-11,The park is not the same park of its original self. The rides have changed to more recent movies but they still provide a fun experience. Christmas season on a Friday the rides were taking less than 20 minutes for most wait times and 30 to 45 for Harry Potter. The shows were fun. The food is expensive but If you try you can find a meal for 15 bucks. The motion simulator rides were very accommodating for big people. We had tall and big belly guys who rode all of those. Overall it was a super fun day. The admission price and parking fee is terrible but that is what amusement parks charge nowadays!!
1074,2019-11,Improved a lot since last visit years back. It was an amazing experience for the whole family. Kids thoroughly enjoyed it. The gringotts ride and transformers ride is the highlight. It was raining but still there was a huge rush. Definitely worth visiting. Christmas break time it was crowded.
1075,2019-11,"Was such an amazing experience.I loved everything about it.My family and I had so much fun.Everyone was so nice,full of people.Good good!"
1076,2019-11,The taputapu is actually such a brilliant idea.It works so easily. They need to get this at every water park. It was the most fun I have ever had at a waterpark. The watercoaster was insane. Food was delicious as well. This is a must see attraction in Orlando.
1077,2019-11,Just back from 4 weeks and have to say it’s our favorite park. Just love the place apart from Fast and furious ride is awful. Jimmy Fallon not much better. Preferred the minions ride in 3D. Apart from that just love it there. If ur going for longer than two weeks buy the annual pass. Free parking and get in the park an hour early. We went 18 times and save 17x 26$ =442$. Plus the discounts nearly everywhere in shops and restaurants.
1078,2019-11,"Absolutely fantastic place for all ages, Loved every minute of my holiday there, Can't wait to go back"
1079,2019-11,Harry Potter world is tops! Be sure to get passes to Island of Adventure as well - you can ride Hogwart's Express between the two HP lands!
1080,2019-11,If you're looking for rides it's not the place. It's the best queue simulator. Entertainment is good but usually you can stand an hour in a line and ride about 5 minutes. However its good park to walk and see.
1081,2019-11,"We had a blast at Universal. Really enjoyed all the rides especially at HP World, Fast and Furious, Minions, Transformers. The show we truly liked was Horror Make Up Show. The presenters were hilarious and the show was interactive which made it really funny. There were no lines at most rides and we got in pretty quick. I love the express pass system and I think it is better than Disney's FastPass. The fact that the park is compact made it a lot easier to navigate."
1082,2019-11,Thank you for having child swap that was doable!! I wen to disney expecting greatness and they failed! Will be back in Feb!!
1083,2019-11,"So being a Disney fan and visiting there several times, I didn't know what to expect from Universal. We stayed on the resort property, the Royal Pacific. I highly recommend staying on property. It's easy to get around and a time saver. If u stay at the 3 Lowe's hotels, u get free express passes for the rides. A great deal. The parks themselves were fun. Volcano Bay is huge and beautiful. We enjoyed Island of Adventure the best. The rides were awesome and immersive. The Harry Potter worlds were fantastic and I'm not a HP fan. My daughter loved it. So comparing Universal with Disney, there are differences of course. The food at Disney, in the parks, is much better. No comparison. Universals express pass system is way better and easier then Disney's fast pass. No planning ahead or strategizing! I liked how Universal was smaller and more compact, thus easier to navigate. I found customer service to be better then I expected at Universal. The photo pass people were great too. The one thing I really liked is how the character meet and greets were at Universal. More impromptu then disney, but very visible. We got pictures with so many characters without waiting in line. Lots of fun! Overall, we were not disappointed with Universal and definitely will be back. I recommend taking your time and give yourself a few days there."
1084,2019-11,We bought a 2 day pass with bonus 3 days for free. We selected dates and the park allocated you a 6 or 7 day window to come any 5 days. We also purchased the Express Pass and Park to Park option which was well worth the extra money. We were running from one ride to another and often only waiting 5 to 10 min to get on the ride. So much fun.  If you are into Harry Potter and Jurassic Park/ World this park is a must.  FYI the parks in California are same price but much smaller.  We had a amazing time.
1085,2019-12,"Once in a lifetime you have to make this pilgrimage. But it’s built on the idea that your kids will gnaw your ears off to have you buy just about anything in the park. The rides are a sideshow.  You’re either standing in line for a ride (even with express) or walking through shops. Sadly, there’s nothing in between.  The park does a great job of managing crowds, they really have it down to a science. Despite the daily onslaught the staff is helpful and friendly. That must be appreciated and noted.  This was the first and last time we go to Universal. Once for one day is enough."
1086,2019-12,"As with my islands of adventure review, that applies to the whole of universal really! The new fast and furious ride was a big disappointment for me. Though I was impressed with the new jimmy falon show ride. All very “if you’ve done it once you’ve done it a million times” but as I’ve said previously universal is a good solid 3-4 days tops of great fun....would I come back again in 2 years time??? I’ll answer that....I did!! Just at the airport and it’s now December 2019!!! Universal just needs another park....or 2, rumours are that they are building one very soon??? I love universal on the whole but there’s just not enough to sink your teeth into!! It’s a 2 day experience if you have fast pass.....which is worth it!!!"
1087,2019-12,"Visited on the December 18th and everything was going great. Wait times weren’t high and the weather was so nice! Towards the end of the night by 7:20, we decided to do Transformers before heading out. As we got to the loading area, we heard two girl employees yell loudly at other people. They were being very rude for no reason and even rolled their eyes at them. I get that you wanna leave and you’re tired but that was no way to treat people! Everyone else was so wonderful so we were very shocked to see that. They had such an impatient tone and would not stop yelling. The ride was empty there’s no need to be that rude!! Please make sure they get spoken to as no one should be treated like that."
1088,2019-12,Totally different experience from Disney. Much more thrill rides and the use of 3D. Our only comments would be the walk ways are fairly narrow for the amount of people serviced and the need for securing loose items on some of the rides in free lockers.
1089,2019-12,"Calm day out as we went on a Tuesday , din need any fast passes as queues were literally only 3-5 minutes wait !"
1090,2019-12,"Started day at Grinch breakfast which was superb, all characters fully interacted well worth the money. Quiet week after Thanksgiving most rides walk on or 15mins max. Harry Potter rides up at 30 mins wait Hagrids 90 min. Watched Maceys xmas parade which was great and then ended night at the Hogwarts light show, fantastic. Great two parks and did most things wanted due to low crowd levels. Top tip... go the week after Thanksgiving if you can, so quiet compared to the summer months."
1091,2019-12,Absoulety nothing it's brilliant the people are so kind always smilen I've been going for 32 years to Orlando it's the best place in the world never had a bad visit complaint ever it's fantastic I go back right into kid mode when I'm there it's a must do must go get saving tho because you need money in Florida
1092,2019-12,"Cool place, not too crowded. Food and drinks are a rip off. 5 dollars for a Gatorade is almost criminal. All memorabilia is too expensive I highly advise Universal to drop prices on T shirts and all the smallthings they sell and sales will increase!!  But all in all a very cool destination ."
1093,2019-12,"long lines, and crowded, over priced.but there where some good times also. rides where fun. don't think i will go back."
1094,2019-12,Popular Harry Potter experience split across 2 parks so have to buy double access to see all of just this one adventure. Cost $300 per adult for 1 day for 2 parks with express pass - which didn’t work on most popular ride- Hagdrid’s motorcycle. Universal very inefficient in everything from parking to entering park to frequent need to show paper pass at attractions. For example in one place had to show agent your pass and get finger printed and not even 5 feet away another employee asked to see ticket again. She had just watch us leave the first employee! Special effects at attractions also need work. Also maybe surprised that you may not fit into the horrible configured/ constricted ride seats. Understand need safe rides but have no issue fitting into airplane seats or Disney thrill ride seats or even one of Universal’s crazy upside down roller coasters but couldn’t fit in any of the Harry Potter rides. . This is our one and only visit to Universal; note have visited Disney about every 2 years for a long time now. Done with Universal.
1095,2019-12,"I love Universal, they have great rides, friendly staff who really know how to do their job, and they are all very nice. Dont waste your time with the fast and furious ride it's horrible."
1096,2019-12,"My son wanted to come here for his 4th birthday. Being around Christmas, it is hard to get time off work but managed to work that out, bought the FL 2-day special, had tickets downloaded to the app on my phone, we arrive for a two day visit and our app only tickets don't work at the gate. Guest service lady wasn't sure if we needed to go to ticket line or guest services. Ultimately, ended up at guest services. Two hours later we make it to a cs rep window where we are asked did we use the tickets before, did we gift them.... Um, no. Why would I be here trying to use them?? Then the teller complains how cold she is while my family just stood out in the sun for two hours. Come to find out the FL special tickets don't upload a barcode to the app and require you to go to guest services to get your tickets. You sold me a 2-day ticket and require me to stand in a line in front of the park for 2 hours for me to get my tickets and you can't give me any notice about this?? Wait, then my family with a cranky complaining 4 year old make me go stand in the long entry line now too. I was and still am so upset. The lady at check in here's our whole story and follows up with ""don't forget to visit the grinch"". I'm not stupid and had no problem telling that girl she was a coward to only be able to creatively tell us to F-off. I've never had any problems like this at D-world. Plus, why can't the guest services initial contact person know enough where to direct people? Also, on a weekend, why only have 3 people working in guest services? I paid for a 2 day ticket and was given a horrible half day experience and then 1.5 days in the park. We deserve a comped day, it's ridiculous. FL residents plan ahead."
1097,2019-12,A Magical place for every group of People . The fun loving land people will remember for lifetime . Must go place .
1098,2019-12,"We had lots of fun here, loads of different rides for all ages, lots places to eat, lots of restrooms, staff very helpful"
1099,2019-12,"Not enough restrooms, and they weren't the cleanist. The one pizza restaurant we ate at, charged for refills on drinks , that was kinda of redicules. Very crowded. Just not really impressed with anything really. There was a good deal on a sunday, at an ice cream place that was nice. Like $6 for a big brownie sunday."
1100,2019-12,My wife and myself visited here with family and we loved it. Universal is my favourite park the rides are great the whole atmosphere is just wonderful.
1101,2019-12,We went to the park today to use our passes for the first time. Making new pass holders wait in the same line as ticket purchases when you have spent around 1500 on tickets to get your pass was a bit of a turn off. We felt like everywhere we went Universal was more concerned with us proving that the passes were ours than us having a good time and benefiting from all the extra money we spent. The new software that makes it so you can’t ride the lines until after 4 now creates a line of people waiting until the clock strikes 4 on the dot so the computer can do a Facial Scan. We didn’t feel like they are worth the money. There is a lot to look at around the park but not a lot to do for rides. There is no discount on the food kiosks - just the restaurants. We just didn’t like the feeling of having to keep proving ourselves when we paid a lot. We didn’t think Universal caters to their pass holders that much. We will not re-new them. I actually would prefer to get my money back because I don’t think we will go that much.
1102,2019-12,Escape from Gringotts is amazing! Just dont bring a backpack or bag any larger than 2 loaves of bread as you need to stow things before the rides and the lockers are very small. Kongs Skull island is also very cool.
1103,2019-12,"This was my first visit to Universal Studios. While I liked the rides better at Island of Adventure, I liked the Universal park better. It was less crowded & laid out better. I came in to this trip thinking it would be similar to Disney, but it’s not even comparable to Disney. I felt that the park, the attractions, & the rides were more similar to Six Flags; just on steroids. Just like I thought with Islands of Adventure, Harry Potter’s Daigon Alley was the best attraction. The Simpsons attraction was a close second. The wait times at Universal were not as long as the wait times at Islands of Adventure. I enjoyed my time at the parks & would definitely go back"
1104,2019-12,"This was my second trip to Orlando at Christmas. I knew from last year they book night time events so I expect one park to close early. We stayed at Loews Sapphire Falls from the 7th to the 12th. My daughter and I had 5 day park to park passes. My sister, niece and great nephew had 5 day 3 park to park passes. I raved about how beautiful it was at night. We like to go back and sit by the pool in the heat of the afternoon and spend the evening in the park. Little did I know that every evening of our trip the parks all closed by 7pm. 5 nights and all closed at 7. Since we were on the road at 2 am to get there the first night we were in bed early. Second night jet lag catches up so now only 3 nights to experience the nights at the park but since it all closed at 7pm we did not get the full experience. Very disappointing for everyone. This was a first trip for my sister, niece and great nephew who I encouraged to come with me this year. It was still fun but I would definitely check out closing times before booking a vacation. Night time at Universal is an incredible experience, with the parade, light shows and just amazing Christmas lights but I feel cheated out of 2 hours each night."
