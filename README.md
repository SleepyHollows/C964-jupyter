In this task, you will organize ideas for your capstone project so that you can create your project more efficiently. In order to start your work on the capstone project, you must discuss your ideas for the project with a course instructor. After you reach an agreement on the topic, you must fill out the top portion of the attached “Computer Science Capstone Topic Approval Form” and send it to the course instructor, who must digitally sign it and lock it to prevent further changes to the document. The completed form signed by the course instructor must be uploaded together with the other documents required for this task.


It is the policy of Western Governors University (WGU) that student capstone projects should not be based on or include any proprietary or classified information. Capstone projects should not contain any material belonging to your employer or any other organization without permission. Such material belongs to this third party and is referred to as “restricted information,” which requires you to obtain the party’s permission to include the work. You must declare whether or not your capstone project is based on and/or includes restricted information as you submit the attached “Capstone Release Form.” This completed attachment gives you permission to use restricted information from a third party. The “Capstone Release Form” must be digitally signed by you.


Projects involving human subjects or the use of protected data will require IRB approval. Work directly with your Course Instructor if your project includes research that involves human subjects in order to determine whether it requires review by WGU’s Institutional Review Board (IRB)
